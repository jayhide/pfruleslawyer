# Creature Types & Subtypes

Each creature has one type, which broadly defines its abilities. Some creatures also have one or more subtypes. A creature cannot violate the rules of its subtype without a special ability or quality to explain the differenceâtemplates can often change a creature’s type drastically.

### PC Playable Races

When discussing or considering a playable race’s type, it’s type is similar to the corresponding creature type, with a few important differences.

  * The first difference is that each **race type** assumes members of the race are roughly [humanoid](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid) in shape and have two arms, two legs, a torso, and a head. This is important so that a race can take advantage of all the various magic item slots available to characters and can utilize the standard weapon and armor options.
  * The second difference is that all of these race types are 0-Hit Dice creatures, which means that their [Hit Dice](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-), [base attack bonus](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Bonus), saving throw progression, skill points, class skills, and weapon and armor proficiencies are based on the class levels each member of a race takes.

Negative energy (such as an _inflict_ spell) can heal undead creatures. The [fast healing](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Fast-Healing-Ex-) special quality works regardless of the creature’s [Intelligence](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-) score.

### Five Things Almost Everyone Knows About Undead

The following are a few facts that are considered common knowledge among civilized peoples.

  1. Most undead were once living. Knowing details about the phase of existence that preceded a creature’s undeath is often invaluable in determining its motives.
  2. [Holy water](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/toys-games-puzzles#TOC-Holy-Water) damages undead as though it were [acid](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/herbs-oils-other-substances#TOC-Acid). Distributed by goodly religious orders the world over, [holy water](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/toys-games-puzzles#TOC-Holy-Water) is the only line of defense against undead for many commoners.
  3. Undead are invariably evil, as are the means to create such beings.
  4. Undead are healed by negative energy and harmed by positive energy.
  5. Undead are immune to numerous magical effects, including [mind-affecting](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Magic-Descriptor-Mind-Affecting) effects and abilities that affect a creature’s physical constitution.



#### Vermin

This type includes insects, arachnids, other arthropods, worms, and similar invertebrates.

Vermin have the following features.

  * d8 [Hit Die](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-).
  * [Base attack bonus](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Base-Attack-Bonus-BAB-) equal to 3/4 total [Hit Dice](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-) (medium progression).
  * Good [Fortitude](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude) saves.
  * Skill points equal to 2 + [Int](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-) modifier (minimum 1) per [Hit Die](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-). Most vermin, however, are mindless and gain no skill points or feats. Vermin have no class skills.



**Traits** : Vermin possess the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature’s entry).

  * Mindless: No [Intelligence](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-) score, and [immunity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Immunity-Ex-or-Su-) to all mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, morale effects, patterns, and phantasms). Mindless creatures have no feats or skills. A vermin-like creature with an [Intelligence](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-) score is usually either an animal or a magical beast, depending on its other abilities.
  * [Darkvision](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Darkvision) 60 feet.
  * Proficient with its [natural weapons](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Natural-Attacks) only.
  * Proficient with no armor.
  * Vermin breathe, eat, and sleep.



# Subtypes

Some creatures have one or more subtypes. Subtypes add additional abilities and qualities to a creature.

#### Adlet Subtype

This subtype is applied to the strange humanoid wolf creatures called [adlets](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/humanoids/adlet), and to creatures related to adlets.

**Editor’s Note** : Adlet is a real-world mythological creature. [Read about it at Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adlet).

#### Aeon Subtype

[Aeons](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/aeon) are a race of [neutral](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alignment-description/additional-rules) outsiders who roam the planes maintaining the balance of reality.

Aeons have the following traits:

  * [Immunity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Immunity-Ex-or-Su-) to cold, [poison](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions#TOC-Poison), and critical hits.
  * [Resistance](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Energy-Resistance) to electricity 10 and fire 10.
  * _Envisaging (Su)_ : Aeons communicate wordlessly, almost incomprehensibly. Caring little for the wants and desires of other creatures, they have no need to engage in exchanges of dialogue. Instead, aeons mentally scan beings for their thoughts and intentions, and then retaliate with flashes of psychic projections that emit a single concept in response to whatever the other being was thinking. The flash is usually a combination of a visual and aural stimulation, which displays how the aeon perceives future events might work out. For instance, an aeon seeking to raze a city communicates this concept to non-aeons by sending them a vivid image of the city crumbling to ash. An aeonâs envisaging functions as a non-verbal form of [telepathy](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Telepathy-Su-). Aeons cannot read the thoughts of any creature immune to mind-affecting effects.
  * _Extension of All (Ex)_ : Through an aeonâs connection to the multiverse, it gains access to strange and abstruse knowledge that filters through all existence. Much of the knowledge is timeless, comprised of events long past, present, and potentially even those yet to come. Aeons gain a [racial bonus](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Racial-Bonus) equal to half their racial [Hit Dice](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-) on all [Knowledge](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/knowledge) skill checks. This same connection also binds them to other aeons. As a result, they can communicate with each other freely, over great distances as if using [telepathy](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Telepathy-Su-). This ability also works across planes, albeit less effectively, allowing the communication of vague impressions or feelings, not specific details or sights. Due to the vast scope of the aeon raceâs multiplanar concerns, though, even the most dire reports of a single aeon rarely inspire dramatic or [immediate action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Immediate-Actions).
  * _Void form (Su)_ : Though aeons arenât [incorporeal](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Incorporeal) , their forms are only a semi-tangible manifestation of something greater. An aeonâs void form grants it a [deflection](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Deflection-Bonus) bonus equal to 1/4 its [Hit Dice](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-) (rounded down).



#### Agathion Subtype

[Agathions](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains/paizo-domains/good-domain/agathion) are beast-aspect outsiders native to [Nirvana](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Nirvana-Neutral-Good-).

Agathion have the following traits:

  * [Low-light vision](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Low-Light-Vision)
  * [Immunity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Immunity-Ex-or-Su-) to electricity and petrification.
  * [Resistance](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Energy-Resistance) to cold 10 and sonic 10.
  * [Lay on hands](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/paladin#TOC-Lay-On-Hands-Su-) as a [paladin](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/paladin) whose level equals the agathionâs [Hit Dice](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-).
  * +4 [racial bonus](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Racial-Bonus) on saving throws against [poison](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions#TOC-Poison).
  * Except where otherwise noted, agathions speak Celestial, Infernal, and Draconic.
  * _Speak with Animals (Su)_ : This ability works like [speak with Animals](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/speak-with-animals) ([caster level](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Caster-Level) equal to the agathionâs [Hit Dice](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-)): but is a [free action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions) and does not require sound.
  * _Truespeech (Su)_ : All agathions can speak with any creature that has a language, as though using a [tongues](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/t/tongues) spell ([caster level](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Caster-Level) equal to angelâs [Hit Dice](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-)). This ability is always active.



#### Air Subtype

This subtype is usually used for outsiders with a connection to the [Elemental Planes](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Elemental-Planes) of Air. Air creatures always have fly speeds and usually have perfect maneuverability. Air creatures treat [Fly](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/fly) as a class skill.

#### Angel Subtype

Angels are a race of celestials, or good outsiders, native to the good-aligned outer planes.

**Traits** : An angel possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature’s entry).

  * [Darkvision](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Darkvision) 60 feet and [low-light vision](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Low-Light-Vision).

  * _Protective Aura (Su)_ Against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures, this ability provides a +4 [deflection bonus](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Deflection-Bonus) to AC and a +4 [resistance bonus](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Resistance-Bonus) on saving throws to anyone within 20 feet of the angel. Otherwise, it functions as a [magic circle against evil](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/m/magic-circle-against-evil) effect and a [lesser globe of invulnerability](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/g/globe-of-invulnerability#lesser), both with a radius of 20 feet ([caster level](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Caster-Level) equals angel’s HD). The defensive benefits from the circle are not included in an angel’s statistics block.
  * _Truespeech (Su)_ All angels can speak with any creature that has a language, as though using a [tongues](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/t/tongues) spell ([caster level](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Caster-Level) equal to angel’s [Hit Dice](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-)).

It cannot breathe air unless it has the [amphibious](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Amphibious-Ex-) special quality. Aquatic creatures always treat [Swim](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/swim) as a class skill.

#### Archon Subtype

[Archons](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/archon) are a race of celestials, or good outsiders, native to [lawful good](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alignment-description/additional-rules#TOC-Lawful-Good)-aligned outer planes.

**Traits** : An archon possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature’s entry).

  * [Darkvision](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Darkvision) 60 feet and [low-light vision](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Low-Light-Vision).
  * _Aura of Menace (Su)_ A righteous aura surrounds archons that fight or get angry. Any hostile creature within a 20-foot radius of an archon must succeed on a [Will](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will) save to resist its effects. The save DC varies with the type of archon, is [Charisma](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-)-based, and includes a +2 [racial bonus](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Racial-Bonus).

#### Asura Subtype

  * _Elusive Aura (Su)_ Asuras exist within reality but apart from it. All but the least of asuras exude an aura that affects all creatures within the area as if by a [nondetection](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/n/nondetection) spell. The size of the aura is proportional to the asuraâs power. The [caster level](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Caster-Level) check to attempt [divination](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/divination) on creatures within the aura is 15 + the [spell-like ability](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-) [caster level](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Caster-Level) of the asura creating the aura.

If a behemoth fails a save against an effect that would kill it instantly, it rises from death 3 rounds later with 1 hit point if no further damage is dealt to its remains. It can be banished or otherwise transported away as a means to save a region, but the only way to truly kill a behemoth is to use [miracle](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/m/miracle) or [wish](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/w/wish) to negate its [regeneration](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Regeneration-Ex-) (see below).

  * _Vulnerable to Miracles and Wishes (Su)_ A spell effect created by a [miracle](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/m/miracle) or [wish](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/w/wish) spell is particularly effective against a behemoth. A spellcaster gains a +6 bonus on its [caster level](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Caster-Level) check to penetrate a behemothâs SR with a [miracle](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/m/miracle) or [wish](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/w/wish) spell, and the behemoth suffers a â6 penalty on saves against these spells. A [miracle](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/m/miracle) or a [wish](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/w/wish) spell can negate a behemothâs [regeneration](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Regeneration-Ex-), but only for 1d4 rounds per casting.



#### Catfolk Subtype

This subtype is applied to the humanoid felines called catfolk and creatures related to catfolk.

#### Chaotic Subtype

This subtype is usually applied to outsiders native to the chaotic-aligned [Outer Planes](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Outer-Planes). Most creatures that have this subtype also have chaotic alignments; however, if their alignments change, they still retain the subtype. Any effect that depends on [alignment](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Alignment) affects a creature with this subtype as if the creature had a chaotic [alignment](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Alignment), no matter what its [alignment](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Alignment) actually is. The creature also suffers effects according to its actual [alignment](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Alignment). A creature with the chaotic subtype overcomes [damage reduction](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Damage-Reduction) as if its [natural weapons](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Natural-Attacks) and any weapons it wields are chaotically aligned.

#### Clockwork Subtype

  * _Vulnerable to Electricity_ : Clockwork constructs take 150% as much damage as normal from electricity attacks.
  * _Swift Reactions (Ex)_ Clockwork constructs generally react much more swiftly than other constructs. They gain [Improved Initiative](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/improved-initiative-combat) and [Lightning Reflexes](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/lightning-reflexes) as bonus feats, and gain a +2 [dodge bonus](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Dodge-Bonus) to AC.
  * _Difficult to Create (Ex)_ The time and gp cost required to create a clockwork is 150% of normal. Construction requirements in individual clockwork monster entries are already increased.



##### Clockwork Augmentations

In addition to the standard special abilities and qualities granted by the clockwork subtype, many clockwork designs incorporate more abilities designed by their engineers. The following examples are intended to help GMs build new clockworks or modify existing ones.

Some of the most common clockwork special abilities have been gathered in this section along with a number of new ones.

  * **Charged (Ex)** : Equipped with a static generator, a clockwork with this special ability deals an additional 1d6 points of electricity damage with all [natural attacks](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules/#Natural_Attacks) and melee weapons it has. **Source** [PAP123](http://amzn.to/2AVM8ho)
  * **Efficient Winding (Ex)** : Built for long missions, a clockwork with this special ability can function for 2 days per [Hit Die](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-) each time itâs wound. If the creatureâs CR is 11 or higher, it can function for 3 days per [Hit Die](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-) each time it is wound. **Source** [PAP123](http://amzn.to/2AVM8ho)
  * **Embedded Ioun Stone (Ex)** : As a [full-round action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Full-Round-Actions), an [ioun stone](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/ioun-stones) can be embedded in (or removed from) a slot in the clockwork creature (usually on its forehead). It is possible to embed or remove an [ioun stone](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/ioun-stones) only if the clockwork is [helpless](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Helpless), [pinned](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Pinned), or willing. The clockwork gains the benefit of the [ioun stone](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/h-l/ioun-stones), including its resonant power. **Source** [PAP123](http://amzn.to/2AVM8ho)
  * **Grind (Ex)** : A clockwork with this special attack deals additional slashing damage when it makes a successful [grapple](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple) [combat maneuver](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuvers) check because of many twisting gears and churning pistons in its body. This additional damage is equal to 1d4 points (1d6 if Large, 1d8 if Huge, 2d6 if Gargantuan, or 3d6 if Colossal) plus 1-1/2 the creatureâs [Strength](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-) bonus. **Source** [PAP123](http://amzn.to/2AVM8ho)
  * **Integrated Firearm (Ex)** : One of the clockworkâs arms ends in a [firearm](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/firearms). The [firearm](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/firearms) generally functions as a [pistol](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/pistol) or [musket](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/musket) intended for a creature of the clockworkâs size, but nearly any [firearm](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/firearms) of suitable size is possible. The clockwork is considered proficient with the weapon. The clockwork can reload an integrated one-handed [firearm](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/firearms) as a [swift action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions) and an integrated two-handed [firearm](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/firearms) as a [move action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Move-Actions). As a [standard action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions), the clockwork can remove the [broken](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Broken) condition from an integrated [firearm](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/firearms), provided that the condition resulted from a misfire. A clockwork usually has 10 rounds of ammunition and gunpowder stored within a reloading mechanism. **Source** [PAP123](http://amzn.to/2AVM8ho)
  * **Proficient (Ex)** : A clockwork with this special ability is proficient with all simple and martial weapons. The clockwork must have humanlike hands in order to gain this ability. **Source** [PAP123](http://amzn.to/2AVM8ho)
  * **Repair Clockwork (Ex)** : Clockworks with this special ability are adept at repairing other [clockwork constructs](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/clockwork-construct-cr-0). As a [standard action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions) that does not provoke an [attack of opportunity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity), the clockwork can repair damage done to either itself or an adjacent clockwork creature, restoring 1d10 [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points) to the target. If the repairing creatureâs CR is 11 or higher, the amount of [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points) restored increases to 2d10. **Source** [PAP123](http://amzn.to/2AVM8ho)
  * **Self-Destruction (Ex)** : When the [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points) of a creature with this special ability are reduced to 10% of its total or less but are still above 0, the creature self-destructs on its next turn, bursting in an explosion of metal scraps and steam in a 20-foot-radius burst. The damage dealt is equal to 1d6 points for each [Hit Die](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-) above 5 the [construct](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Construct) has (clockworks with 5 or fewer [Hit Dice](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-) cannot gain this ability). Half of this damage is fire damage and half is slashing damage. A target that succeeds at a [Reflex](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex) save (DC = 10 + half the clockworkâs [Hit Dice](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-) \+ the creatureâs [Constitution](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-) modifier [usually 0]) takes half damage. **Source** [PAP123](http://amzn.to/2AVM8ho)
  * **Standby (Ex)** : A clockwork creature with this special ability can place itself on standby as a [standard action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions). While on standby, the clockwork creature cannot move or take any actions. It remains aware of its surroundings but takes a â4 penalty on [Perception](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perception) checks. Time spent on standby does not count against the clockworkâs wind-down duration. The clockwork can exit standby as a [swift action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions). If it does so to initiate combat, it gains a +4 [racial bonus](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Racial-Bonus) on its [Initiative](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Initiative) check. **Source** [PAP123](http://amzn.to/2AVM8ho)
  * **Tough Alloys (Ex)** : The clockwork gains [Toughness](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/toughness) as a bonus feat.

#### Colossus Subtype

Colossi are [Mythic](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/mythic#TOC-Mythic) [constructs](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Construct) of Gargantuan [size](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Size-Bonus) or larger. Unless otherwise noted in a creature’s entry, colossi have the following traits.

  * _Selective Antimagic Aura (Su)_ A colossus exudes a constant [antimagic field](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/a/antimagic-field), as the spell, with a radius equal to its reach. Typically, this field ignores specified schools of magic or spell descriptors. A colossus’s own [spell-like abilities](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-) and [supernatural](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Supernatural-Abilities-Su-) abilities are not affected by this aura.
  * _Alternate Form (Ex)_ Colossi have the ability to transform themselves into some other shape. This transformation is non-magical, and is not revealed by [true seeing](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/t/true-seeing) or similar magic.

  * _Pinning Stomp (Ex)_ When a colossus is in its normal form, as a [swift action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions) it can make a single melee attack at its highest base attack against a target three or more size categories smaller than the colossus. This attack deals an amount of damage equal to twice that of its slam attack plus 1-1/2 times the colossus’s [Strength](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-) bonus. If the colossus hits with this attack, it can attempt a [grapple](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple) check as a [free action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions). This [grapple](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple) doesn’t provoke [attacks of opportunity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity). If the [grapple](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple) is successful, the target is [pinned](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Pinned) and takes an amount of damage equal to that of the colossus’s slam attack each round at the start of the colossus’s turn until either the [pinned](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Pinned) creature frees itself or the colossus moves out of the [pinned](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Pinned) creature’s space. The colossus doesn’t need to attempt [grapple](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple) checks to continue the [pin](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Pinned), nor can it attempt a check to move, further damage, or tie up the [grappled](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Grappled) creature. A colossus can at most two creatures [pinned](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Pinned) with this attack at one time.
  * _Mythic Creation (Ex)_ A colossus can be created only by a creator with a [Mythic Tier](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/mythic#TOC-Mythic-Tier) or rank equal to or greater than that of the colossus it is attempting to create.
  * _Mythic Resilience (Ex)_ A colossus can expend one use of [Mythic Power](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/mythic#TOC-Mythic-Power) as [swift action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions) to double its damage reduction for 1 round.

  * _Faith-Stealing Strike (Su)_ When a demodandâs [natural attack](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules/#Natural_Attacks) or melee weapon damages a creature capable of casting divine spells, that creature must make a [Will](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will) saving throw or be unable to cast any divine spells for 1 round. Once a creature makes this save, it is immune to further faith-stealing strikes from that particular demodand for 24 hours. The save DC is [Charisma](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-)-based.

#### Extraplanar Subtype

This subtype is applied to any creature when it is on a plane other than its native plane. A creature that travels the planes can gain or lose this subtype as it goes from plane to plane. Monster entries assume that encounters with creatures take place on the [Material Plane](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Material-Plane1), and every creature whose native plane is not the [Material Plane](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Material-Plane1) has the extraplanar subtype (but would not have it when on its home plane). Every extraplanar creature in this book has a home plane mentioned in its description. creatures not labeled as extraplanar are natives of the [Material Plane](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Material-Plane1), and they gain the extraplanar subtype if they leave the [Material Plane](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Material-Plane1). No creature has the extraplanar subtype when it is on a transitive plane, such as the [Astral Plane](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Astral-Plane), the [Ethereal Plane](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Ethereal-Plane), or the Plane of Shadow.

Giants have [low-light vision](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Low-Light-Vision), and treat [Intimidate](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/intimidate) and [Perception](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perception) as class skills.

#### Gnome Subtype

This subtype is applied to [gnomes](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/gnome) and creatures related to [gnomes](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/gnome). creatures with the gnome subtype have [low-light vision](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Low-Light-Vision).

#### Godspawn Subtype

**Source** : [PZO9267](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1601255977/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1601255977&linkCode=as2&tag=httpwwwd20pfs-20)

All Godspawn are Colossal [magical beasts](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Magical-Beast) that possess the following traits.

**Hibernation (Ex)** Godspawn can sleep for years, decades, or even centuries and do not need to eat or breathe during these periods of dormancy. If a godspawn is forced into an environment where it cannot breathe and would suffocate, it goes into hibernation until conditions are right for it to reawaken. While in hibernation, a godspawn’s [damage reduction](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Damage-Reduction) improves to 50/epic and it gains [immunity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Immunity-Ex-or-Su-) to any spell or [spell-like ability](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-) that allows [spell resistance](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Spell-Resistance) as well as all [divination](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/divination) effects.

**Regeneration (Ex)** All godspawn possess [regeneration](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Regeneration-Ex-), and no form of attack can suppress this [regeneration](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Regeneration-Ex-); they regenerate even if disintegrated or slain by a death effect. If a godspawn fails a save against an effect that would kill it instantly, it rises from death 3 rounds later with 1 hit point if no further damage is dealt to its remains. It can be banished or otherwise transported as a means to save a region, but a method to kill godspawn has yet to be discovered.

**Unstoppable Force (Ex)** A godspawn can always [charge](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Charge), even if its movement is impeded or its path is blocked by another creature. It receives a +20 [racial bonus](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Racial-Bonus) on [combat maneuver](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuvers) checks to [overrun](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Overrun) and [Strength](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-) checks to break or destroy objects, and can make one such check as a [free action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions) as part of a charge. In addition, the [natural weapons](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Natural-Attacks) of a godspawn ignore all forms of [damage reduction](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Damage-Reduction) and [hardness](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/damaging-objects#TOC-Hardness).

#### Good Subtype

This subtype is usually applied to outsiders native to the good-aligned [Outer Planes](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Outer-Planes). Most creatures that have this subtype also have good alignments; however, if their alignments change, they still retain the subtype. Any effect that depends on [alignment](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Alignment) affects a creature with this subtype as if the creature has a good [alignment](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Alignment), no matter what its [alignment](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Alignment) actually is. The creature also suffers effects according to its actual [alignment](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Alignment). A creature with the good subtype overcomes [damage reduction](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Damage-Reduction) as if its [natural weapons](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Natural-Attacks) and any weapons it wields are good-aligned.

#### Great Old One Subtype

A Great Old One is a powerful, alien entityâa being from another world, from another dimension, or even from the distant past or future. All Great Old Ones are chaotic, and most of them are also evil. They can be any creature type, but most are [aberrations](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Aberration) or [magical beasts](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Magical-Beast). Great Old Ones have the following traits.

  * A Great Old One’s [natural weapons](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Natural-Attacks), as well as any weapon it wields, are treated as chaotic, epic, and [Mythic](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/mythic#TOC-Mythic) for the purpose of overcoming [damage reduction](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Damage-Reduction).
  * Although Great Old Ones grant spells to their worshipers, they don’t seem to be interested in their worshipers beyond their own inscrutable endsâa Great Old One is just as likely to destroy one of its cultists as it is to destroy a nonbeliever. A Great Old One grants access to four domains and four subdomains, and its cults have a favored weaponâthe exact details vary for each Great Old One.
  * _Immortality (Ex)_ A Great Old One does not need to eat, drink, or breathe, nor does it age. A Great Old One that is slain does not truly dieârather, it is forced into an extended period of dormancy that can last years, centuries, or longer. Exact details of this vary and are described in individual creature entries. Methods to permanently slay a Great Old One might exist, but such methods have yet to be learned by mortals. [Immunity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Immunity-Ex-or-Su-) to [ability damage](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage), [ability drain](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Drain), aging, cold, death effects, [disease](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/diseases), [energy drain](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/e/energy-drain), [mind-affecting](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Magic-Descriptor-Mind-Affecting) effects, [paralysis](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Paralysis), and petrification.
  * _Insanity (Ex)_ Any creature that attempts to interact directly with a Great Old One’s thoughts (such as via [detect thoughts](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/detect-thoughts) or [telepathy](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Telepathy-Su-)) must succeed at a [Will](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will) save or be driven permanently insane. The save DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 the Great Old One’s [Hit Dice](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-) \+ the Great Old One’s [Charisma](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-) modifier. This duplicates the effect of the [insanity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/i/insanity) spell, or the insanity rules (in which case the save DC is also the ongoing [insanity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/i/insanity) DC). A Great Old One using its [telepathy](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Telepathy-Su-) to communicate doesn’t [activate](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Activate-Magic-Item) this ability unless it spends a [standard action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions) to focus its mind on one opponent. This is a [mind-affecting](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Magic-Descriptor-Mind-Affecting) effect.
  * _Mythic (Su)_ A Great Old One has [Mythic Power](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/mythic#TOC-Mythic-Power) (10/day, [Surge](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/mythic#TOC-Surge) +1d12) and counts as a 10th-rank [Mythic](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/mythic#TOC-Mythic) creature. A Great Old One can use any of its [spell-like abilities](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-) as the [Mythic](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/mythic#TOC-Mythic) versions of those spells (if a [Mythic](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/mythic#TOC-Mythic) version of that spell exists), expending [Mythic Power](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/mythic#TOC-Mythic-Power) as normal. It can also [expend](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/e/expend) [Mythic Power](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/mythic#TOC-Mythic-Power) to use the augmented versions of these [spell-like abilities](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-).
  * _Otherworldly Insight (Ex)_ All Great Old Ones gain a +10 [insight bonus](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Insight-Bonus) on [Initiative](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Initiative) checks and to AC.
  * _Unspeakable Presence (Su)_ A Great Old One’s aura inflicts intense mental anguish and torment upon all creatures within 300 feet who can see and hear the Great Old One. The exact effects caused by a Great Old One’s unspeakable presence vary by type. A successful [Will](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will) save (DC 10 + 1/2 the Great Old One’s [Hit Dice](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-) \+ the Great Old One’s [Charisma](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-) modifier) reduces or negates the effect. This is a [mind-affecting](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Magic-Descriptor-Mind-Affecting) effect.



#### Halfling Subtype

This subtype is applied to [halflings](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/halfling) and creatures related to [halflings](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/halfling).

#### Herald Subtype

**Source** : [PZO9267](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1601255977/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1601255977&linkCode=as2&tag=httpwwwd20pfs-20)

Heralds are a special class of unique, godly servants. With few exceptions, each deity has its own herald, a favored minion that serves as a messenger and emissary throughout the planes. Creatures of myth, the heralds’ interventions on the [Material Plane](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Material-Plane1) mark lives and are events of legend.

Heralds are unique [outsiders](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Outsider) of approximately CR 15 with 18 or fewer [Hit Dice](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-), making them available for summons via greater [greater planar ally](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/p/planar-ally). Only a deity’s worshipers can summon its herald. In addition, only divine spellcasters can summon heralds, preventing arcane casters and spells like [planar binding](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/p/planar-binding) from effectively calling upon such beings. Even if a character proves powerful enough to call out to a herald, a deity has the final say in whether or not its emissary answers a worshiper’s summons, granting its herald’s service only to followers in the most extreme need or whose acts directly further its will.

Heralds are unique representatives of their respective gods and sometimes have a specific [outsider](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Outsider) subtype such as “[devil](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Devil)” or “[psychopomp](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Psychopomp)” that grants it additional abilities. A herald has the following traits.

**Always Armed (Su)** Heralds can summon their signature weapon as a [standard action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions). If a herald doesn’t have a signature weapon, it can summon any non-magical weapon as a [standard action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions) (including [adamantine](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/special-materials#TOC-Adamantine), etc.); the weapon disappears if it leaves the herald’s grasp.

**Emissary (Ex)** Heralds can always be summoned by the faithful using [greater planar ally](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/p/planar-ally) or [gate](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/g/gate), regardless of limitations of that spell, even if it’s not an [outsider](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Outsider).

#### Hive Subtype

**Source** [PZO1135](http://amzn.to/2chJpnf "PZO1135")

The hive are an invasive species of [aberrations](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Aberration) that consume worlds like locusts. Hive creatures have the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creatureâs entry).

  * **Immunity** Hives are immune to acid damage.
  * **Blind** : A hive creature is [blind](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Blinded). It is immune to [gaze](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Gaze-Su-) attacks, visual effects, illusions, and other attack forms that rely on sight. Unlike other [aberrations](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Aberration), a hive creature doesnât have [darkvision](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Darkvision).
  * **Blindsense** Hives have blindsense 60 feet.
  * **Blindsight** Hives have blindsight 10 feet.



**Corrosive Blood (Ex)** A hive creatureâs blood is highly caustic. Every time the hive creature is damaged by a piercing or slashing weapon, the attacking creature takes acid damage according to the table below (or double damage if the attack is a [critical hit](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Critical-Hits)). Using a reach weapon does not endanger the attacker in this way. If the hive creature has the [swallow whole](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Swallow-Whole-Ex-) ability, it adds this damage to its [swallow whole](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Swallow-Whole-Ex-) damage.

Size of Hive Creature | Points of Acid Damage  
---|---  
Medium or smaller | 1d4  
Large | 1d6  
Huge | 1d8  
Gargantuan | 2d6  
Colossal | 2d8  
  
**Death Throes (Ex)** When a hive creature dies, it exudes a pool of its corrosive blood in the space it occupies. This pool deals 1d6 points of acid damage per [Hit Die](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-) of the hive creature for 3 rounds to objects and creatures in those squares ([Reflex](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex) half ). This acid damages whatever surface it is on, and if it deals enough damage to destroy the surface, the acid falls down to any subsequent floor below and continues to deal damage. The save DC is [Constitution](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-)-based.

**Heat Adaptability (Ex)** Hive creatures are considered to always be under the effect of [endure elements](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/e/endure-elements) with regard to hot climates.

**Hive Mind (Ex)** Hive creatures have no language of their own, instead communicating simple concepts via pheromone discharge and body language that other creatures with the hive subtype understand. This ability functions within line of sight. If one hive creature is able to act in the [surprise](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Surprise) round of combat, all other hive creatures in line of sight can also act, and a hive creature isnât [flanked](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Flanking) unless all hive creatures within line of sight are [flanked](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Flanking).

A hive creature doesnât need to eat, drink, or sleep.

#### Human Subtype

This subtype is applied to [humans](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/human) and creatures related to [humans](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/human).

#### Incorporeal Subtype

An incorporeal creature has no physical body. An incorporeal creature is immune to critical hits and precision-based damage (such as [sneak attack](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue#TOC-Sneak-Attack) damage) unless the attacks are made using a weapon with the [ghost touch](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons#TOC-Ghost-Touch) special weapon quality. In addition, creatures with the incorporeal subtype gain the [incorporeal special quality](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Incorporeal-Ex-).

#### Inevitable Subtype

Inevitables are construct-like outsiders built by the [axiomites](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/axiomite) to enforce law.

Inevitables have the following traits:

  * [Low-light vision](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Low-Light-Vision)
  * _Constructed (Ex)_ : Although inevitables are living outsiders , their bodies are constructed of physical [components](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Components), and in many ways they function as constructs. For the purposes of effects targeting creatures by type (such as a [rangerâs](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/ranger) [favored enemy](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/ranger#TOC-Favored-Enemy-Ex-) and [bane](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons#TOC-Bane) weapons), [inevitables](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/inevitable) count as both outsiders and constructs. They are immune to death effects, [disease](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions#TOC-Diseases), mind-affecting effects, [necromancy](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Necromancy) effects, [paralysis](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Paralysis), [poison](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions#TOC-Poison), [sleep](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/sleep), [stun](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Stunned), and any effect that requires a [Fortitude](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude) save (unless the effect also works on objects, or is harmless). Inevitables are not subject to [nonlethal damage](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Nonlethal-Damage), [ability damage](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Ability-Damage-and-Drain-Ex-or-Su-), [ability drain](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Ability-Damage-and-Drain-Ex-or-Su-), [fatigue](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Fatigued), [exhaustion](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Exhausted), or [energy drain](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/e/energy-drain). They are not at risk of death from massive damage. They have bonus [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points) as constructs of their size.
  * _Saves_ : An inevitableâs good [saving throws](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Saving-Throws) are [Fortitude](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude) and [Will](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will).
  * _Skills_ : In addition to the class skills all outsiders have, [inevitables](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/inevitable) have [Acrobatics](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/acrobatics), [Diplomacy](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/diplomacy), [Intimidate](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/intimidate), and [Survival](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/survival) as class skills.
  * _Regeneration (Ex)_ : Inevitables have [regeneration](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Regeneration-Ex-) /chaotic. The [regeneration](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Regeneration-Ex-) amount varies by the type of [inevitable](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/inevitable).
  * _Truespeech (Su)_ : An inevitable can speak with any creature that has a language, as if using a [tongues](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/t/tongues) spell ([caster level](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Caster-Level) 14th). This ability is always active.



#### Kaiju Subtype

These Colossal creatures inhabit the most desolate places of a world. When they are not slumbering, they roam the world, leaving destruction in their wake. A kaiju possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature’s entry).

  * A kaiju’s [natural attacks](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules/#Natural_Attacks) count as epic and magic for the purpose of overcoming [damage reduction](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Damage-Reduction).
  * [Damage Reduction](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Damage-Reduction) 20/epic.
  * [Darkvision](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Darkvision) 600 feet.
  * [Fast healing](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Fast-Healing-Ex-) 30.
  * _Ferocity (Ex)_ All kaiju possess the [ferocity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Ferocity-Ex-) universal monster ability.
  * _Hurl Foe (Ex)_ When a kaiju damages a Huge or smaller foe with one of its [natural attacks](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules/#Natural_Attacks), it can try to hurl the foe as part of that attack by attempting a [combat maneuver](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuvers) check. On a successful check, the foe is knocked back 10 feet in a direction of the kaiju’s choice and falls [prone](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Prone). The distance the foe is hurled increases by 10 feet for every 5 points by which the kaiju’s check exceeds the foe’s [CMD](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuver-Defense). If an obstacle stops the hurled creature before it travels the whole distance, the hurled foe and the obstacle struck each take 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet of distance remaining and the foe is knocked [prone](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Prone) in the space adjacent to the obstacle.
  * [Immunity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Immunity-Ex-or-Su-) to [ability damage](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage), [ability drain](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Drain), death effects, [disease](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/diseases), [energy drain](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/e/energy-drain), and [fear](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Fear).
  * _Massive (Ex)_ Because kaiju are so massive, uneven ground and other terrain features that form difficult terrain generally pose no significant hindrance to a kaiju’s movement, though areas of forest or settlements are considered difficult terrain to a kaiju. A Huge or smaller creature can move through any square occupied by a kaiju, or vice-versa. A kaiju can make [attacks of opportunity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity) only against foes that are Huge or larger, and can be [flanked](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Flanking) only by Huge or larger foes. A kaiju gains a bonus for being on higher ground only if its entire space is on higher ground than that of its target. It’s possible for a Huge or smaller creature to climb a kaijuâthis generally requires a successful DC 30 check, and unlike the normal rules about kaiju and [attacks of opportunity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity), a Small or larger creature that climbs on a kaiju’s body provokes an [attack of opportunity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity) from the monster.
  * _Recovery (Ex)_ Whenever a kaiju fails a saving throw against any [mind-affecting](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Magic-Descriptor-Mind-Affecting), [paralysis](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Paralysis), petrification, [polymorph](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/p/polymorph), or immobilizing effect (including [binding](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/binding) and [temporal stasis](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/t/temporal-stasis) but not including [imprisonment](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/i/imprisonment)), it can attempt a new saving throw at the end of its turn to remove the effect. Doing so takes no action. A kaiju can attempt a new save to end the effect as often as it wishes, but can attempt to remove only one such effect per round. Once per year, if a kaiju takes an amount of damage that would normally kill it by reducing its [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points) to a negative amount equal to its [Constitution](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-) score, the damage instead heals the kaiju of twice the amount of damageâbut this healing leaves the kaiju disoriented and demoralized. At this point, the creature becomes [nauseated](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Nauseated) and seeks only to return to its lair. Any amount of damage dealt to it by an external source before it reaches its lair, though, immediately negates the [nauseated](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Nauseated) effect and allows the kaiju to end its retreat and attack.
  * Resistance 30 against acid, cold, electricity, fire, negative energy, and sonic.



#### Kami Subtype

Kami are a race of native outsiders who serve to protect what they refer to as âwardsââanimals, plants, objects, and even locationsâfrom being harmed or dishonored. All kami are outsiders with the native subtype. A kami possesses the following traits unless otherwise noted in a creatureâs entry.

  * Immune to [bleed](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/bleed), mind-affecting effects, petrification, and [polymorph](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/p/polymorph) effects.
  * Resist acid 10, electricity 10, fire 10
  * Although they are native outsiders, kami do not eat, drink, or breathe.
  * [Telepathy](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Telepathy-Su-).
  * _Fast Healing (Ex)_ As long as a kami is within 120 feet of its ward, it gains [fast healing](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Fast-Healing-Ex-). The amount of [fast healing](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Fast-Healing-Ex-) it gains depends on the type of kami.
  * _Merge with Ward (Su)_ As a [standard action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions), a kami can merge its body and mind with its ward. When merged, the kami can observe the surrounding region with its senses as if it were using its own body, as well as via any senses its ward might have. It has no control over its ward, nor can it communicate or otherwise take any action other than to emerge from its ward as a [standard action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions). A kami must be adjacent to its ward to merge with or emerge from it. If its ward is a creature, plant, or object, the kami can emerge mounted on the creature provided the kamiâs body is at least one size category smaller than the creature. If its ward is a location, the kami may emerge at any point within that location.
  * _Ward (Su)_ A kami has a specific wardâa creature with a 2 or lower [Intelligence](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-) (usually an animal or vermin), a plant (not a plant creature), an object, or a location. The type of ward is listed in parentheses in the kamiâs stat block. Several of a kamiâs abilities function only when it is either merged with its ward or within 120 feet of it. If a kamiâs ward is portable and travels with the kami to another plane, the kami does not gain the extraplanar subtype on that other plane as long as its ward remains within 120 feet. If a ward is destroyed while a kami is merged with it, the kami dies (no save). If a ward is destroyed while a kami is not merged with it, the kami loses its merge with ward ability and its [fast healing](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Fast-Healing-Ex-), and becomes permanently [sickened](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Sickened).



**Editor’s Note** : Kami are a real-world mythological creature or concept. [Read more about it at Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kami).

#### Kasatha Subtype

A kasatha is a nimble four-armed [humanoid](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid) from another planet.

#### Kitsune Subtype

A [kitsune](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/other-races/uncommon-races/arg-kitsune) is a shapechanging [humanoid](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid) [fox](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/fox)-person.

#### Kyton Subtype

Kytons are a race of [lawful evil](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alignment-description/additional-rules#TOC-Lawful-Evil) outsiders native to the [Plane of Shadow](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Shadow-Plane) who feed on fear and pain. Kytons possess the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creatureâs entry).

  * [Darkvision](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Darkvision) 60 feet.
  * _Regeneration (Ex)_ The extent of a kytonâs [regeneration](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Regeneration-Ex-) varies according to type, and can be neutralized by good weapons, good spells, and silver weapons.
  * [Immunity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Immunity-Ex-or-Su-) to cold.
  * _Unnerving Gaze (Su)_ All kytons have a [gaze](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Gaze-Su-) attack that manipulates the perceptions of those who look upon them. An unnerving gaze has a range of 30 feet, and can be negated by a [Will](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will) saveâthe exact effects caused by a particular kytonâs unnerving gaze depend on the type of kyton. All kytons are immune to the unnerving gazes of other kytons. Unnerving [gaze](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Gaze-Su-) is always a mind-affecting [fear](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/f/fear) effect. The save DC is [Charisma](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-)-based.



#### Lawful Subtype

This subtype is usually applied to outsiders native to the lawful-aligned [Outer Planes](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Outer-Planes). Most creatures that have this subtype also have lawful alignments; however, if their alignments change, they still retain the subtype. Any effect that depends on [alignment](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Alignment) affects a creature with this subtype as if the creature had a lawful [alignment](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Alignment), no matter what its [alignment](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Alignment) actually is. The creature also suffers effects according to its actual [alignment](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Alignment). A creature with the lawful subtype overcomes [damage reduction](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Damage-Reduction) as if its [natural weapons](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Natural-Attacks) and any weapons it wields are lawful-aligned.

#### Leshy Subtype

A leshy is a nature spirit that inhabits the body of a specially grown plant. Regardless of their kind, all leshys share the following traits in addition to those granted by the plant type (unless otherwise noted in a creatureâs entry).

  * [Darkvision](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Darkvision) 60 feet and [low-light vision](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Low-Light-Vision).
  * [Immunity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Immunity-Ex-or-Su-) to electricity and sonic.
  * _Spell-Like Abilities_ : All leshys have [pass without trace](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/p/pass-without-trace) as a constant [spell-like ability](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-) (CL equal to twice the leshyâs HD).
  * _Change Shape (Su)_ All leshys can transform into plants, with results similar to the [tree shape](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/t/tree-shape) spell. Unlike that spell, this ability only allows [transformation](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/t/transformation) into Small plants of the same type of growth the leshy is related to. In this form, the leshy appears as a particularly healthy specimen of that particular plant. A leshy can assume plant form or revert to its [true form](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/t/true-form) as a [swift action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions).
  * _Plantspeech (Ex)_ All leshys can [speak with plants](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/speak-with-plants) as if subject to a continual [speak with plants](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/speak-with-plants) spell, but only with species they are related to.
  * _Verdant Burst (Su)_ When slain, a leshy explodes in a burst of fertile energies. All plant creatures within 30 feet of a slain leshy heal 1d8 points of damage plus 1 point per HD of the slain leshy, and plant life of the same type as the leshy itself quickly infests the area. If the terrain can support this type of plant, the undergrowth is dense enough to make the region into difficult terrain for 24 hours, after which the plant life diminishes to a normal level; otherwise, the plant life has no significant effect on movement and withers and dies within an hour.
  * Except where otherwise noted, all leshys speak Druidic and Sylvan.



#### Mortic Subtype

**Source** : [PAP139](https://amzn.to/2ExaFgY)

Mortic is a [humanoid](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid) subtype; the angheuvore and jitterbone on pages 86â87 are examples of mortics, and future volumes of the Tyrantâs Grasp Adventure Path will include additional mortics.

A mortic is a [humanoid](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid) creature infused with necromantic energy but not truly [undead](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead). Although mortics reproduce to create others of their kind, usually living in tight-knit communities, a [humanoid](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid) of any type might become a mortic through overwhelming exposure to negative energy. Mortics vary in their abilities based on their original [humanoid](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid) type, and each mortic has a [humanoid](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid) subtype in addition to the mortic subtype. Mortics have racial [Hit Dice](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-) and never substitute such [Hit Dice](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-) for class levels like some [humanoids](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid) do. All mortics have the following traits unless otherwise noted in a specific creatureâs entry.

  * [Darkvision](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Darkvision) 60 ft.
  * A morticâs good save is always [Fortitude](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude).
  * [Negative energy affinity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Negative-Energy-Affinity-Ex-).
  * A mortic treats [Intimidate](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/intimidate), [Perception](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perception), and [Stealth](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/stealth) as class skills.



**Death Gasp (Su)** A mortic that holds her breath suspends the majority of her living processes. While holding her breath, a mortic is immune to [ability drain](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Drain), [energy drain](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/e/energy-drain), and [sleep](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/sleep) effects. A mortic who holds her breath is also immune to [bleed](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Bleed) effects, [disease](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/diseases), and [poison](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison); any such effects are suspended for as long as the mortic holds her breath, although this doesnât cure any damage that the [bleed](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Bleed) effect, [disease](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/diseases), or [poison](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison) has already done. A mortic can hold her breath for a number of rounds equal to 4 times her [Constitution](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-) score.

**Unliving Nature (Ex)** Although a mortic is a living creature, she is treated both as [undead](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead) and as her normal type and subtype for the purposes of spells and effects (for example, she can be detected with [detect undead](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/detect-undead) and rendered immobile by either [halt undead](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/h/halt-undead) or [hold person](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/h/hold-person)). A mortic never takes a penalty on [Disguise](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/disguise) checks to disguise herself as an [undead](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead) creature. Mortics gain a +4 [racial bonus](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Racial-Bonus) on saving throws against [mind-affecting](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Magic-Descriptor-Mind-Affecting) effects.

**Vulnerable to Consecration (Ex)** A mortic is [staggered](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Staggered) within the area of a [consecrate](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/c/consecrate) effect.

  * DR 5/epic if the creature has at least 5 [Hit Dice](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-). If the creature already had [DR](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Damage-Reduction-Ex-or-Su-), it adds epic to the qualities needed to bypass that reduction.
  * Mythic feats, which generally are improved versions of standard feats. [Mythic](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/mythic#TOC-Mythic) feats are indicated by an M.
  * _Mythic Power (Su)_ The creature has the [Mythic Power](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/mythic#TOC-Mythic-Power) and [Surge](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/mythic#TOC-Surge) universal monster abilities. The effect of these abilities depend on its [Mythic Rank](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/mythic#TOC-Mythic-Rank).
  * Mythic rank, a number from 1 to 10, representing its overall [Mythic Power](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/mythic#TOC-Mythic-Power).

This aura can be negated by [dispel evil](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/dispel-evil), but a nightshade can reactivate it on its turn as a [free action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions).

[Mind blank](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/m/mind-blank) and [nondetection](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/n/nondetection) prevent the latter effect but not the nightshadeâs [true seeing](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/t/true-seeing).
  * _Light Aversion (Ex)_ : A nightshade in bright light becomes [sickened](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Sickened)âthe penalties from this condition are doubled when the nightshade is in natural sunlight.

A rakshasa can suppress or resume this ability as a [free action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions). When a rakshasa uses this ability, it always functions as if it had spent 3 rounds concentrating and thus gains the maximum amount of information possible. The [Will](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will) save DC to resist this effect is equal to 10 + 1/2 the rakshasaâs HD + the rakshasaâs [Charisma](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-) modifier.
  * _Enhanced Defenses (Ex)_ All rakshasas have [DR](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Damage-Reduction-Ex-or-Su-) that can be penetrated by good and piercing weapons only.

#### Ratfolk Subtype

This subtype is applied to the humanoid rodents called [ratfolk](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/humanoids/ratfolk) and creatures related to ratfolk.

#### Reptilian Subtype

These creatures are scaly and usually cold-blooded. The reptilian subtype is only used to describe a set of humanoid races, not all animals and monsters that are true reptiles.

#### Robot Subtype

Although some people call them things like âautomatons,â âmetal men,â or the like, these technological creations are all robots, and as such, they share similar traits. Robots share some features with [clockwork constructs](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/clockwork-construct-cr-0), and as with clockworks, you can simply remove the robot subtype from a robot (along with its attendant traits) to transform it into a typical construct animated by magic.

Likewise, you can add the robot subtype (and traits) to any existing construct to transform it into something created by technology. Adding the robot subtype to a construct does not affect its CR. A single construct cannot possess both the robot and the clockwork subtype.

All robots gain the following traits.

  * **Robot Subtype** : The construct gains the ârobotâ subtype.
  * **Intelligent** : Robots are intelligent, and thus have skills and feats as appropriate for their [Hit Dice](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-). Unless otherwise indicated for a specific robot, all robots have [Intelligence](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-) scores of 10. The following are class skills for robots: [Climb](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/climb), [Disable Device](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/disable-device), [Fly](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/fly), [Knowledge](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/knowledge) (all), [Linguistics](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/linguistics), [Perception](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perception), and [Sense Motive](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/sense-motive).
  * **Vulnerable to Critical Hits** : Whenever a robot takes extra damage from a [critical hit](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Critical-Hits), it must make a DC 15 [Fortitude](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude) save to avoid being [stunned](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Stunned) for 1 round. If it makes the saving throw, it is instead [staggered](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Staggered) for 1 round.
  * **Vulnerable to Electricity** : Robots take 150% as much damage as normal from electricity attacks, unless they are immune to electricity via other special defenses.
  * **Difficult to Create** : Increase the time and gp cost required to create a robot by 50% over normal for a construct, unless the creator has access to a significant amount of technological resources.

#### Samsaran Subtype

A [samsaran](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/other-races/uncommon-races/arg-samsaran) is a [humanoid](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid) creature whose spirit always reincarnates into another samsaran.

#### Sasquatch Subtype

This subtype is applied to the humanoid beings called [sasquatches](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/humanoids/sasquatch) and creatures related to sasquatches.

#### Shapechanger Subtype

A shapechanger has the [supernatural](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Supernatural-Abilities-Su-) ability to assume one or more alternate forms. Many magical effects allow some kind of shapeshifting, and not every creature that can change shape has the shapechanger subtype.

A shapechanger possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature’s entry).

  * Proficient with its [natural weapons](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Natural-Attacks), with simple weapons, and with any weapons mentioned in the creature’s description.
  * Proficient with any armor mentioned in the creature’s description, as well as all lighter forms. If no form of armor is mentioned, the shapechanger is not proficient with armor. A shapechanger is proficient with shields if it is proficient with any type of armor.



#### Swarm Subtype

A swarm is a collection of Fine, Diminutive, or Tiny creatures that acts as a single creature. A swarm has the characteristics of its type, except as noted here. A swarm has a single pool of [Hit Dice](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-) and [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points), a single [initiative](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Initiative) modifier, a single speed, and a single [Armor Class](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Armor-Class). A swarm makes [saving throws](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Saving-Throws) as a single creature. A single swarm occupies a square (if it is made up of nonflying creatures) or a cube (of flying creatures) 10 feet on a side, but its reach is 0 feet, like its component creatures. In order to attack, it moves into an opponentâs space, which provokes an [attack of opportunity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity). A swarm can occupy the same space as a creature of any size, since it crawls all over its prey. A swarm can move through squares occupied by enemies and vice versa without impediment, although the swarm provokes an [attack of opportunity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity) if it does so. A swarm can move through cracks or holes large enough for its component creatures.

A swarm of Tiny creatures consists of 300 nonflying creatures or 1,000 flying creatures. A swarm of Diminutive creatures consists of 1,500 nonflying creatures or 5,000 flying creatures. A swarm of Fine creatures consists of 10,000 creatures, whether they are flying or not. Swarms of nonflying creatures include many more creatures than could normally fit in a 10-foot square based on their normal space, because creatures in a swarm are packed tightly together and generally crawl over each other and their prey when moving or attacking. Larger swarms are represented by multiples of single swarms. The area occupied by a large swarm is completely shapeable, though the swarm usually remains in contiguous squares.

**Traits** : A swarm has no clear front or back and no discernible anatomy, so it is not subject to critical hits or [flanking](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Flanking). A swarm made up of Tiny creatures takes half damage from slashing and piercing weapons. A swarm composed of Fine or Diminutive creatures is immune to all weapon damage. Reducing a swarm to 0 [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points) or less causes it to break up, though damage taken until that point does not degrade its ability to attack or resist attack. Swarms are never [staggered](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Staggered) or reduced to a [dying](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dying) state by damage. Also, they cannot be [tripped](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Trip), [grappled](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Grappled), or bull rushed, and they cannot [grapple](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple) an opponent.

A swarm is immune to any spell or effect that targets a specific number of creatures (including single-target spells such as [disintegrate](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/disintegrate)), with the exception of mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, morale effects, patterns, and phantasms) if the swarm has an [Intelligence](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-) score and a hive mind. A swarm takes half again as much damage (+50%) from spells or effects that affect an area, such as [splash weapons](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Throw-Splash-Weapon) and many [evocation](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Evocation) spells.

Swarms made up of Diminutive or Fine creatures are susceptible to high winds, such as those created by a [gust of wind](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/g/gust-of-wind) spell. For purposes of determining the effects of wind on a swarm, treat the swarm as a creature of the same size as its constituent creatures. A swarm rendered [unconscious](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Unconscious) by means of [nonlethal damage](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Nonlethal-Damage) becomes disorganized and dispersed, and does not reform until its [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points) exceed its [nonlethal damage](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Nonlethal-Damage).

Table: Swarm Damage by Size Swarm HD | Swarm Base Damage  
---|---  
1â5 | 1d6  
6â10 | 2d6  
11â15 | 3d6  
16â20 | 4d6

_Swarm Attack_ : creatures with the swarm subtype donât make standard melee attacks. Instead, they deal automatic damage to any creature whose space they occupy at the end of their move, with no [attack roll](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll) needed. Swarm attacks are not subject to a miss chance for [concealment](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Concealment) or [cover](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Cover). A swarmâs stat block has âswarmâ in the Melee entries, with no [attack bonus](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Bonus) given.

The amount of damage a swarm deals is based on its [Hit Dice](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-), as shown on **Table: Swarm Damage by Size**.

A swarmâs attacks are nonmagical, unless the swarmâs description states otherwise. Damage reduction sufficient to reduce a swarm attackâs damage to 0, being [incorporeal](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Incorporeal-Ex-), or other Special Abilities usually give a creature [immunity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Immunity-Ex-or-Su-) (or at least [resistance](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Energy-Resistance)) to damage from a swarm. Some swarms also have acid, [blood drain](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Blood-Drain-Ex-), [poison](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions#TOC-Poison), or other special attacks in addition to normal damage.

Swarms do not threaten creatures, and do not make [attacks of opportunity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity) with their swarm attack. However, they distract foes whose squares they occupy, as described below.

Swarms possess the [distraction](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Distraction-Ex-) ability. Spellcasting or concentrating on spells within the area of a swarm requires a [caster level](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Caster-Level) check (DC 20 + spell level). Using skills that involve patience and [concentration](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Concentration) requires a DC 20 [Will](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will) save.

#### Troop Subtype

The troop subtype represents an organized group of trained soldiers that act as a unit, rather than as individuals. A troop is something of an abstraction, in that the component creatures that make up the troop are mostly irrelevant; only the troop as a whole matters for the purposes of combat. A troop is similar to a [swarm](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Swarm), but is normally composed of Small or Medium creatures. Large groups of Tiny or smaller creatures should use the normal [swarm](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Swarm) rules.

**Traits** : A troop is not subject to [flanking](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Flanking), but it is subject to critical hits and [sneak attacks](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue#TOC-Sneak-Attack) if its component creatures are subject to such attacks. Reducing a troop to 0 [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points) or fewer causes it to break up, effectively destroying the troop, though the damage taken until that point does not degrade its ability to attack or resist attack.

All troops gain the following traits.

  * **Troop Subtype** : A troop is a collection of creatures that acts as a single creature, similar to a [swarm](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Swarm), but typically as part of a military unit. A troop has the characteristics of its type, except as noted here. A troop has a single pool of [Hit Dice](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-) and [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points), a single [initiative](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Initiative) modifier, a single speed, and a single [armor class](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Armor-Class). A troop makes saving throws as a single creature. A single troop occupies a 20-foot-by-20-foot square, equal in size to a Gargantuan creature, though the actual size category of the troop is the same as that of the component creatures. The area occupied by a troop is completely shape-able, though the troop must remain in contiguous squares to accurately reflect the teamwork of trained military units. A troop has a reach equal to that of the component creatures based on size or armament. A troop can move through squares occupied by enemies and vice versa without impediment, although the troop provokes an [attack of opportunity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity) if it does so. A troop can move through any area large enough for its component creatures. The exact number of a troop’s component creatures varies, but in general, a troop of Small or Medium creatures consists of approximately 12 to 30 creatures. Larger creatures can form troops, but the area occupied by such a troop should increase proportionally according to the size of the component creatures.
  * A troop is never [staggered](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Staggered) or reduced to a [dying](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dying) state by damage.
  * **[Immunity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Immunity-Ex-or-Su-) to being Tripped or Bull Rushed**: A troop cannot be [tripped](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Trip), [grappled](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Grappled), or bull rushed, except by area effects that include such effects. A troop can [grapple](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple) an opponent.
  * **[Immunity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Immunity-Ex-or-Su-) to Single Target Spells**: A troop is immune to any spell or effect that targets a specific number of creatures (including single-target spells such as [disintegrate](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/disintegrate) and multiple target spells such as [haste](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/h/haste)), though it is affected by spells or effects that target an area or a nonspecific number of creatures (such as [fireball](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/f/fireball) or [mass hold monster](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/h/hold-monster)).
  * **Vulnerable to Area Effect Spells** : A troop takes half again as much damage (+50%) from spells or effects that affect an area. If a troop is rendered [unconscious](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Unconscious) by means of [nonlethal damage](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Nonlethal-Damage), it disperses and does not reform until its [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points) exceed its [nonlethal damage](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Nonlethal-Damage).
  * **Troop Attack** : Creatures with the troop subtype don’t make standard melee attacks. Instead, they deal automatic damage to any creature within reach or whose space they occupy at the end of their move, with no [attack roll](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll) needed. A troop’s stat block has âtroopâ in its Melee entry with no [attack bonus](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Bonus) given. The amount of damage a troop deals is based on its [Hit Dice](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Hit-Dice-HD-). Unless stated otherwise, a troop’s attacks are non-magical. [Damage Reduction](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Damage-Reduction) sufficient to reduce a troop attack’s damage to 0 or other special abilities can give a creature [immunity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Immunity-Ex-or-Su-) (or at least resistance) to the troop’s attacks. Some troops also have other special attacks in addition to normal damage. Troops threaten all creatures within their reach or within their area, and attempt [attacks of opportunity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity) as normal with their troop attack.
  * **Chaos of Combat** : Because of the chaos of combat, spellcasting or concentrating on spells within the area of a troop or within its reach requires a [caster level](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Caster-Level) check (DC 20 + spell level). Using skills that involve patience and [concentration](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Concentration) requires a successful DC 20 [Will](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will) save.



**Looting Troops** Although troops are composed of a number of individual creatures, the chaos and destruction of battle means that not all of these creatures’ equipment survives the rigors of combat. As a result, parties who wish to claim usable gear or treasure from slain foes treat a troop as a single creature for the purposes of looting.

#### Udaeus Subtype

An udaeus is a member of a warlike [Mythic](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/mythic#TOC-Mythic) [humanoid](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid) race originally created from dragon teeth.

#### Unbreathing Subtype

**Source** : Adventurerâs Handbook: Genius Guide Volume 1

Unbreathing is a subtype that can be applied to [magical beasts](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Magical-Beast) and humanoids. Unbreathing creatures are alive, but share the appearance of and some traits with undead creatures. Unbreathing creatures have strong connections to the powers of death, just as creatures with the cold or fire subtype are connected to those forces. Unbreathing are not undead, however, and must eat, [sleep](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/sleep) and even (occasionally) breathe. Most unbreathing creatures look like [zombie](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/zombie) or [ghoul](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/ghoul) versions of their normal cousins, though a rare few have transparent hide and flesh, making them look like animate [skeletons](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/undead/skeleton-medium).

  * Unbreathing creatures can choose to not breathe for a duration of one minute per point of [Constitution](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-) score. After this duration, they use normal drowning/suffocation rules.
  * Spells and effects that affect or damage undead also affect or damage unbreathing creatures. Spells or effects that specify they do not affect undead do not affect unbreathing creatures.
  * Unbreathing creatures cannot have the fire subtype. They gain resistance to cold equal to one point per level or hit die.
  * Unbreathing creatures are resistant to [healing](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Conjuration-Healing) magic. They receive only half the hp of [healing](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Conjuration-Healing) granted by any magic source of [healing](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Conjuration-Healing).



#### Vanara Subtype

This subtype is applied to [vanaras](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/humanoids/vanara) and creatures related to vanaras.

#### Vishkanya Subtype

This subtype is applied to [vishkanyas](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/humanoids/vishkanya) and creatures related to vishkanyas.

#### Water Subtype

This subtype is usually used for Outsiders with a connection to the [Elemental Planes](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Elemental-Planes) of Water. Creatures with the water subtype always have swim speeds and can move in water without making [Swim](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/swim) checks. A water creature can breathe underwater and can usually breathe air as well. Water creatures treat the [Swim](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/swim) skill as a class skill.

#### Wayang Subtype

A [wayang](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/other-races/uncommon-races/arg-wayang) is a gangly [humanoid](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid) originating from the [Shadow Plane](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes#TOC-Shadow-Plane1).

#### Wild Hunt Subtype

**Source** Â [PRG:B6](https://amzn.to/2HAqHGY)

All creatures that ride as a part of the wild hunt are chaotic neutral fey that have the following abilities (unless otherwise noted in a creatureâs entry).

  * Immunity to cold.
  * Resistance to electricity and fire 10.
  * _Enhanced Senses (Ex)_ : All members of the wild hunt have greensight 60 feet, scent, and see in darkness.
  * _Instinctive Cooperation (Ex)_ : Creatures with the wild hunt subtype are immune to all supernatural abilities of other creatures with the wild hunt subtype that allow a saving throw (such as wild gaze).
  * _Planar Acclimation (Ex)_ : A creature with the wild hunt subtype is always considered to be on its home plane, regardless of what plane it finds itself upon. It never gains the extraplanar subtype.
  * _Speak with Nature (Sp)_ : Wild hunt creatures haveÂ know direction,Â speak with animals, andÂ speak with plantsÂ as constant spell-like abilities, and can castÂ stone tellÂ as a spell-like ability 3 times per day.
  * _Wild Gaze (Su)_ : All creatures within 30 feet that fail a Will save against the gaze of a member of the wild hunt instinctively recognize their power. Humanoids and monstrous humanoids stand frozen in awe, becoming paralyzed. Magical beasts and animals become frightened, and all other creatures become confused. These effects last for 1 round, and multiple failed saving throws against multiple members of the wild hunt in a single round do not cause this duration to stack. A creature that succeeds on a saving throw against this special attack is immune to the wild gaze from any member of the wild hunt for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
  * _Wild Grace (Su)_ : Wild hunt creatures add their Charisma modifier as a deflection bonus to their AC.
  * _Wild Hunt Link (Su)_ : Members of the wild hunt can communicate telepathically across great distances and share abilities with each other. As long as a member of the hunt is not more than 500 feet away from the nearest other member of its hunt, it can participate in the wild hunt link. Each wild hunt creature shares a different set of abilities with other creatures in the link. A lone member of the wild hunt does not gain the benefit of any abilities it grants via its wild hunt link, and identical abilities granted by multiple wild hunt fey do not stack.
