# Armor & Shields

For most, armor is the simplest way to protect oneself in a world of rampant threats and dangers. Many characters can wear only the simplest of armors, and only some can use shields. To wear heavier armor effectively, a character can select the Armor Proficiency feats, but most classes are automatically proficient with the armors that work best for them.

Here is the format for armor entries (given as column headings on **Table: Armor and Shields**).

### Cost

The cost in gold pieces of the armor for Small or Medium humanoid creatures. See **Table: Armor for Unusual Creatures** for armor prices for other creatures.

### Armor/Shield Bonus

Each type of armor grants an armor bonus to Armor Class, while shields grant a shield bonus to Armor Class. The armor bonus from a suit of armor doesn’t stack with other effects or items that grant an armor bonus. Similarly, the shield bonus from a shield doesn’t stack with other effects that grant a shield bonus.

### Maximum Dex Bonus

This number is the maximum Dexterity bonus to Armor Class that this type of armor allows. Dexterity bonuses in excess of this number are reduced to this number for the purposes of determining the wearer’s Armor Class. Heavier armors limit mobility, reducing the wearer’s ability to dodge blows. This restriction doesn’t affect any other Dexterity-related abilities.

Even if a character’s Dex bonus to Armor Class drops to 0 because of armor, this situation does not count as losing his Dex bonus to Armor Class.

A character’s encumbrance (the amount of gear carried, including armor) may also restrict the maximum Dex bonus that can be applied to his Armor Class.

_Shields_ : Shields do not affect a character’s maximum Dex bonus, except for tower shields.

### Armor Check Penalty

Any armor heavier than leather, as well as any shield, hurts a character’s ability to use Dex– and Str-based skills. An armor check penalty applies to all Dex– and Strength-based skill checks. A character’s encumbrance may also incur an armor check penalty.

_Shields_ : If a character is wearing armor and using a shield, both armor check penalties apply.

_Nonproficient with Armor Worn_ : A character who wears armor and/or uses a shield with which he is not proficient takes the armor’s (and/or shield’s) armor check penalty on attack rolls as well as on all Dex– and Str-based ability and skill checks. The penalty for non-proficiency with armor stacks with the penalty for shields.

_Sleeping in Armor_ : A character who sleeps in medium or heavy armor is automatically fatigued the next day. He takes a –2 penalty on Str and Dex and can’t charge or run. Sleeping in light armor does not cause fatigue.

### Arcane Spell Failure Chance

Armor interferes with the gestures that a spellcaster must make to cast an arcane spell that has a somatic component. Arcane spellcasters face the possibility of arcane spell failure if they’re wearing armor. Bards can wear light armor and use shields without incurring any arcane spell failure chance for their bard spells.

_Casting an Arcane Spell in Armor_ : A character who casts an arcane spell while wearing armor must usually make an arcane spell failure check. The number in the Arcane Spell Failure Chance column on **Table: Armor and Shields** is the percentage chance that the spell fails and is ruined. If the spell lacks a somatic component, however, it can be cast with no chance of arcane spell failure.

_Shields_ : If a character is wearing armor and using a shield, add the two numbers together to get a single arcane spell failure chance.

### Speed

Medium or heavy armor slows the wearer down. The number on **Table: Armor and Shields** is the character’s speed while wearing the armor. Humans, elves, half-elves, and half-orcs have an unencumbered speed of 30 feet. They use the first column. Dwarves, gnomes, and halflings have an unencumbered speed of 20 feet. They use the second column. Remember, however, that a dwarf’s land speed remains 20 feet even in medium or heavy armor or when carrying a medium or heavy load.

_Shields_ : Shields do not affect a character’s speed.

### Weight

This column gives the weight of the armor sized for a Medium wearer. Armor fitted for Small characters weighs half as much, and armor for Large characters weighs twice as much.

### Damaging Armor

The following information is copied and slightly reworded from the broken condition. See the broken condition for the full, original text.

Armor or shields that have taken damage in excess of half their total hit points gain the broken condition, meaning they are less effective at their designated task. The broken condition has the following effects, depending upon the item.

The AC bonus armor or a shield grants is halved, rounded down, and its armor check penalty to skill checks is doubled.

## Masterwork Armor

Just as with weapons, you can purchase or craft masterwork versions of armor or shields. Such a well-made item functions like the normal version, except that its armor check penalty is lessened by 1.

The _masterwork transformation_ spell transforms a non-masterwork weapon into a masterwork weapon. Without using magic, you can’t add the masterwork quality to armor or a shield after it is created; it must be crafted as a masterwork item (see the Craft skill).

A masterwork suit of armor or shield costs an extra 150 gp over and above the normal cost for that type of armor or shield.

The masterwork quality of a suit of armor or shield never provides a bonus on attack or damage rolls, even if the armor or shield is used as a weapon.

All magic armors and shields are automatically considered to be of masterwork quality.

Even though some types of armor and shields can be used as weapons, you can’t create a masterwork version of such an item that confers an enhancement bonus on attack rolls. However, you can create masterwork armor spikes and shield spikes, which do confer their enhancement bonus on attack rolls to attacks made with the spikes.

## Getting Into and Out of Armor

Putting on or taking off armor is a sometimes complicated procedure. The time required to don armor depends on its type; see **Table: Donning Armor**.

**Don** : This column tells how long it takes a character to put the armor on. (One minute is 10 rounds.) Readying (strapping on) a shield is only a move action.

**Don Hastily** : This column tells how long it takes to put the armor on in a hurry. The armor check penalty and armor bonus for hastily donned armor are each 1 point worse than normal.

**Remove** : This column tells how long it takes to get the armor off. Removing a shield from the arm and dropping it is only a move action.

Table: Donning Armor Armor Type | Don | Don Hastily | Remove  
---|---|---|---  
Shield (any) | 1 move action | n/a | 1 move action  
Padded, leather, hide, studded leather, or chain shirt | 1 minute | 5 rounds | 1 minute1  
Breastplate, scale mail, chainmail, banded mail, or splint mail | 4 minutes1 | 1 minute | 1 minute1  
Half-plate or full plate | 4 minutes2 | 4 minutes1 | 1d4+1 minutes1  
  
1 If the character has some help, cut this time in half. A single character doing nothing else can help one or two adjacent characters. Two characters can’t help each other don armor at the same time.  
2 The wearer must have help to don this armor. Without help, it can be donned only hastily.
