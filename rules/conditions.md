#### Bleed

FAQ

![](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2017/01/faq-bleed-1.gif)

[[Source](http://paizo.com/paizo/messageboards/paizoPublishing/pathfinder/pathfinderRPG/rules/bleedIsntCumulativeAndNaturalAttacksAlwaysThreatenRight&page=1#12)]

A creature that is taking bleed damage takes the listed amount of damage at the beginning of its turn. Bleeding can be stopped by a DC 15 [Heal](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/heal) check or through the application of any spell that cures hit point damage (even if the bleed is ability damage). Some bleed effects cause ability damage or even ability drain. Bleed effects do not stack with each other unless they deal different kinds of damage. When two or more bleed effects deal the same kind of damage, take the worse effect. In this case, ability drain is worse than ability damage.

#### Blinded

The creature cannot see. It takes a â2 penalty to [Armor Class](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Armor-Class), loses its [Dexterity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-) bonus to [AC](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Armor-Class) (if any), and takes a â4 penalty on most [Strength](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-)– and [Dexterity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-)-based skill checks and on opposed [Perception](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perception) skill checks. All checks and activities that rely on vision (such as reading and [Perception](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perception) checks based on sight) automatically fail. All opponents are considered to have total [concealment](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Concealment) (50% miss chance) against the blinded character. Blind creatures must make a DC 10 [Acrobatics](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/acrobatics) skill check to move faster than half speed. Creatures that fail this check fall prone. Characters who remain blinded for a long time grow accustomed to these drawbacks and can overcome some of them.

#### Broken

Items that have taken damage in excess of half their total [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points) gain the broken condition, meaning they are less effective at their designated task. The broken condition has the following effects, depending upon the item.

  * If the item is a weapon, any attacks made with the item suffer a â2 penalty on attack and damage rolls. Such weapons only score a critical hit on a natural 20 and only deal Ã2 damage on a confirmed critical hit.
  * If the item is a suit of armor or a shield, the bonus it grants to [AC](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Armor-Class) is halved, rounding down. Broken armor doubles its armor check penalty on skills.
  * If the item is a tool needed for a skill, any skill check made with the item takes a â2 penalty.
  * If the item is a [wand](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wands) or staff, it uses up twice as many charges when used.
  * If the item does not fit into any of these categories, the broken condition has no effect on its use. Items with the broken condition, regardless of type, are worth 75% of their normal value. If the item is magical, it can only be repaired with a [_mending_](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/m/mending) or [_make whole_](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/m/make-whole) spell cast by a character with a [caster level](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Caster-Level) equal to or higher than the item’s. Items lose the broken condition if the spell restores the object to half its original [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points) or higher. Non-magical items can be repaired in a similar fashion, or through the [Craft](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/craft) skill used to create it. Generally speaking, this requires a DC 20 [Craft](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/craft) check and 1 hour of work per point of damage to be repaired. Most craftsmen charge one-tenth the item’s total cost to repair such damage (more if the item is badly damaged or ruined).



**Special Note on Ships** : Ships, and sometimes their means of propulsionâare objects, and like any other object, when they take damage in excess of half their [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points), they gain the broken condition. When a ship gains the broken condition, it takes a â2 penalty to AC, on sailing checks, saving throws, and on [combat maneuver](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuvers) checks. If a ship or its means of propulsion becomes broken, the ship’s maximum speed is halved and the ship can no longer gain the upper hand until repaired. If the ship is in motion and traveling faster than its new maximum speed, it automatically decelerates to its new maximum speed (from [Advanced Naval Combat](other-rules/ship-combat/advanced-naval-combat).)

#### Confused

A confused creature is mentally befuddled and cannot act normally. A confused creature cannot tell the difference between ally and foe, treating all creatures as enemies. Allies wishing to cast a beneficial spell that requires a touch on a confused creature must succeed on a melee [touch attack](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Touch-Attacks). If a confused creature is attacked, it attacks the creature that last attacked it until that creature is dead or out of sight.

Roll on the following table at the beginning of each confused subject’s turn each round to see what the subject does in that round.

d% | Behavior  
---|---  
01â25 | Act normally.  
26â50 | Do nothing but babble incoherently.  
51â75 | Deal 1d8 points of damage + Str modifier to self with item in hand.  
76â100 | Attack nearest creature (for this purpose, a familiar counts as part of the subject’s self).  
  
A confused creature who can’t carry out the indicated action does nothing but babble incoherently. Attackers are not at any special advantage when attacking a confused creature. Any confused creature who is attacked automatically attacks its attackers on its next turn, as long as it is still confused when its turn comes. Note that a confused creature will not make attacks of opportunity against anything that it is not already devoted to attacking (either because of its most recent action or because it has just been attacked).

#### Cowering

The character is frozen in fear and can take no actions. A cowering character takes a â2 penalty to [Armor Class](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Armor-Class) and loses his [Dexterity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-) bonus (if any).

#### Dazed

The creature is unable to act normally. A dazed creature can take no actions, but has no penalty to [AC](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Armor-Class).

A dazed condition typically lasts 1 round.

#### Dazzled

The creature is unable to see well because of over-stimulation of the eyes. A dazzled creature takes a â1 penalty on attack rolls and sight-based [Perception](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perception) checks.

FAQ

The last 3.5 Dungeons & Dragons FAQ that was released by Wizards of the Coast stated that a dead body is treated as an object, and thus it can be damaged using the rules for âSmashing an Objectâ. As far as we (d20pfsrd.com editors) know, there has been no such statement for Pathfinder so whether or not this is true in your campaign should be considered GM discretion.

#### Dead

The character’s [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points) are reduced to a negative amount equal to his [Constitution](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-) score, his [Constitution](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-) drops to 0, or he is killed outright by a spell or effect. The character’s soul leaves his body. Dead characters cannot benefit from normal or magical healing, but they can be restored to life via magic. A dead body decays normally unless magically preserved, but magic that restores a dead character to life also restores the body either to full health or to its condition at the time of death (depending on the spell or device). Either way, resurrected characters need not worry about rigor mortis, decomposition, and other conditions that affect dead bodies.

#### Deafened

A deafened character cannot hear. He takes a â4 penalty on [initiative](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Initiative) checks, automatically fails [Perception](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perception) checks based on sound, takes a â4 penalty on opposed [Perception](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perception) checks, and has a 20% chance of spell failure when casting spells with verbal [components](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Components). Characters who remain deafened for a long time grow accustomed to these drawbacks and can overcome some of them.

#### Disabled

A character with 0 [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points), or one who has negative [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points) but has become stable and conscious, is disabled. A disabled character may take a single [move action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Move-Actions) or [standard action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions) each round (but not both, nor can he take full-round actions, but he can still take swift, immediate, and free actions). He moves at half speed. Taking move actions doesn’t risk further injury, but performing any [standard action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions) (or any other action the GM deems strenuous, including some free actions such as casting a [Quicken Spell](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/metamagic-feats/quicken-spell-metamagic) spell) deals 1 point of damage after the completion of the act. Unless the action increased the disabled character’s [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points), he is now in negative [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points) and dying.

A disabled character with negative [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points) recovers [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points) naturally if he is being helped. Otherwise, each day he can attempt a DC 10 [Constitution](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-) check after resting for 8 hours, to begin recovering [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points) naturally. The character takes a penalty on this roll equal to his negative hit point total. Failing this check causes the character to lose 1 hit point, but this does not cause the character to become unconscious. Once a character makes this check, he continues to heal naturally and is no longer in danger of losing [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points) naturally.

#### Dying

A dying creature is unconscious and near death. Creatures that have negative [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points) and have not stabilized are dying. A dying creature can take no actions. On the character’s next turn, after being reduced to negative [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points) (but not dead), and on all subsequent turns, the character must make a DC 10 [Constitution](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-) check to become stable. The character takes a penalty on this roll equal to his negative hit point total. A character that is stable does not need to make this check. A natural 20 on this check is an automatic success. If the character fails this check, he loses 1 hit point. If a dying creature has an amount of negative [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points) equal to its [Constitution](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-) score, it dies.

#### Energy Drained

FAQ

Does energy drain count as a death effect?

Energy drain is not a death effect.

The undead type calls out immunities to “death effects” and “energy drain” as separate things.

The Death Attacks description in the Core Rulebook doesn’t mention negative levels or energy drain.

“Energy Drain and Negative Levels” is an entirely separate entry in the Core Rulebook and doesn’t say energy drain is a type of death attack, not does it say that death ward protects against them.

The death ward spell gives a bonus against death spells and magical death effects, and goes on to say that the target is immune to energy drain, and suspends penalties from negative levels while the spell is active.

Therefore the rules treat energy drain and death effects as different things. For example, if you are immune to death effects, you aren’t necessarily immune to energy drain.

[[Source](http://paizo.com/paizo/faq/v5748nruor1fm#v5748eaic9r9f)]

The character gains one or more negative levels, which might become permanent. If the subject has at least as many negative levels as Hit Dice, he dies. See [Energy Drain and Negative Levels](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Energy-Drain-and-Negative-Levels) and **FAQ** for additional information.

#### Entangled

The character is ensnared. Being entangled impedes movement, but does not entirely prevent it unless the bonds are anchored to an immobile object or tethered by an opposing force. An entangled creature moves at half speed, cannot run or [charge](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Charge), and takes a â2 penalty on all attack rolls and a â4 penalty to [Dexterity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-). An entangled character who attempts to cast a spell must make a [concentration](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Concentration) check (DC 15 + spell level) or lose the spell.

#### Exhausted

An exhausted character moves at half speed, cannot run or [charge](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Charge), and takes a â6 penalty to [Strength](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-) and [Dexterity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-). After 1 hour of complete rest, an exhausted character becomes fatigued. A fatigued character becomes exhausted by doing something else that would normally cause fatigue.

#### Fascinated

A fascinated creature is entranced by a supernatural or spell effect. The creature stands or sits quietly, taking no actions other than to pay attention to the fascinating effect, for as long as the effect lasts. It takes a â4 penalty on skill checks made as reactions, such as [Perception](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perception) checks. Any potential threat, such as a hostile creature approaching, allows the fascinated creature a new [saving throw](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Saving-Throws) against the fascinating effect. Any obvious threat, such as someone drawing a weapon, casting a spell, or aiming a ranged weapon at the fascinated creature, automatically breaks the effect. A fascinated creature’s ally may shake it free of the spell as a [standard action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions).

#### Fatigued

A fatigued character can neither [run](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Run) nor [charge](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Charge) and takes a â2 penalty to [Strength](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-) and [Dexterity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-). Doing anything that would normally cause fatigue causes the fatigued character to become exhausted. After 8 hours of complete rest, fatigued characters are no longer fatigued.

#### Flat-Footed

A character who has not yet acted during a combat is flat-footed, unable to react normally to the situation. A flat-footed character loses his [Dexterity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-) bonus to [AC](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Armor-Class) and Combat Maneuver Defense (CMD) (if any) and cannot make attacks of opportunity, unless he has the [Combat Reflexes](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/combat-reflexes-combat) feat or Uncanny Dodge class ability.

Characters with Uncanny Dodge retain their [Dexterity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-) bonus to their [AC](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Armor-Class) and can make attacks of opportunity before they have acted in the first round of combat.

> _Editor’s Note:_ Reference from immediate action rules: You cannot take immediate actions while flat-footed.

#### Frightened

A frightened creature flees from the source of its fear as best it can. If unable to flee, it may fight. A frightened creature takes a â2 penalty on all attack rolls, [saving throws](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Saving-Throws), skill checks, and ability checks. A frightened creature can use special abilities, including spells, to flee; indeed, the creature must use such means if they are the only way to escape.

Frightened is like shaken, except that the creature must flee if possible. Panicked is a more extreme state of fear.

#### Grappled

A grappled creature is restrained by a creature, trap, or effect. Grappled creatures cannot move and take a â4 penalty to [Dexterity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores/#Dexterity_Dex). A grappled creature takes a â2 penalty on all attack rolls and combat maneuver checks, except those made to grapple or escape a grapple. In addition, grappled creatures can take no action that requires two hands to perform. A grappled character who attempts to cast a spell or use a spell-like ability must make a [concentration](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/#TOC-Concentration) check (DC 10 + grappler’s CMB + spell level), or lose the spell. Grappled creatures cannot make attacks of opportunity.

A grappled creature cannot use [Stealth](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/stealth/) to hide from the creature grappling it, even if a special ability, such as hide in plain sight, would normally allow it to do so. If a grappled creature becomes invisible, through a spell or other ability, it gains a +2 [circumstance bonus](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary/#TOC-Circumstance-Bonus) on its CMD to avoid being grappled, but receives no other benefit.

#### Helpless

A helpless character is paralyzed, held, bound, sleeping, unconscious, or otherwise completely at an opponent’s mercy. A helpless target is treated as having a [Dexterity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-) of 0 (â5 modifier). Melee attacks against a helpless target get a +4 bonus (equivalent to attacking a prone target). Ranged attacks get no special bonus against helpless targets. Rogues can sneak attack helpless targets.

As a [full-round action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Full-Round-Actions), an enemy can use a melee weapon to deliver a coup de grace to a helpless foe. An enemy can also use a bow or crossbow, provided he is adjacent to the target. The attacker automatically hits and scores a critical hit. (A [rogue](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue) also gets his sneak attack damage bonus against a helpless foe when delivering a coup de grace.) If the defender survives, he must make a [Fortitude](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude) save (DC 10 + damage dealt) or die. Delivering a coup de grace provokes attacks of opportunity.

Creatures that are immune to critical hits do not take critical damage, nor do they need to make [Fortitude](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude) saves to avoid being killed by a coup de grace.

#### Incorporeal

Creatures with the incorporeal condition do not have a physical body. Incorporeal creatures are immune to all nonmagical attack forms. Incorporeal creatures take half damage (50%) from magic weapons, spells, spell-like effects, and supernatural effects. Incorporeal creatures take full damage from other incorporeal creatures and effects, as well as all force effects. See [here](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules/#Incorporeal_Ex) for additional information.

#### Invisible

Invisible creatures are visually undetectable. An invisible creature gains a +2 bonus on attack rolls against sighted opponents, and ignores its opponents’ [Dexterity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-) bonuses to [AC](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Armor-Class) (if any). See the [invisibility special ability](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities/#TOC-Invisibility).

#### Nauseated

Creatures with the nauseated condition experience stomach distress. Nauseated creatures are unable to attack, cast spells, concentrate on spells, or do anything else requiring attention. The only action such a character can take is a single move action per turn.

#### Panicked

A panicked creature must drop anything it holds and flee at top speed from the source of its fear, as well as any other dangers it encounters, along a random path. It can’t take any other actions. In addition, the creature takes a â2 penalty on all [saving throws](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Saving-Throws), skill checks, and ability checks. If cornered, a panicked creature cowers and does not attack, typically using the [total defense](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Total-Defense) action in combat. A panicked creature can use special abilities, including spells, to flee; indeed, the creature must use such means if they are the only way to escape.

Panicked is a more extreme state of fear than shaken or frightened.

#### Paralyzed

A paralyzed character is frozen in place and unable to move or act. A paralyzed character has effective [Dexterity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-) and [Strength](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-) scores of 0 and is helpless, but can take purely mental actions. A winged creature flying in the air at the time that it becomes paralyzed cannot flap its wings and falls. A paralyzed swimmer can’t swim and may drown. A creature can move through a space occupied by a paralyzed creatureâally or not. Each square occupied by a paralyzed creature, however, counts as 2 squares to move through.

#### Petrified

A petrified character has been turned to stone and is considered unconscious. If a petrified character cracks or breaks, but the broken pieces are joined with the body as he returns to flesh, he is unharmed. If the character’s petrified body is incomplete when it returns to flesh, the body is likewise incomplete and there is some amount of permanent hit point loss and/or debilitation.

#### Pinned

A pinned creature is tightly bound and can take few actions. A pinned creature cannot move and is denied its Dexterity bonus. A pinned character also takes an additional â4 penalty to his [Armor Class](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Armor-Class). A pinned creature is limited in the actions that it can take. A pinned creature can always attempt to free itself, usually through a combat maneuver check or [Escape Artist](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/escape-artist) check. A pinned creature can take verbal and mental actions, but cannot cast any spells that require a somatic or material component. A pinned character who attempts to cast a spell or use a spell-like ability must make a [concentration](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Concentration) check (DC 10 + grappler’s CMB + spell level) or lose the spell. Pinned is a more severe version of grappled, and their effects do not stack.

#### Prone

The character is lying on the ground. A prone attacker has a â4 penalty on melee attack rolls and cannot use a ranged weapon (except for a crossbow). A prone defender gains a +4 bonus to [Armor Class](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Armor-Class) against ranged attacks, but takes a â4 penalty to [AC](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Armor-Class) against melee attacks.

Standing up is a move-equivalent action that provokes an attack of opportunity.

#### Shaken

A shaken character takes a â2 penalty on attack rolls, [saving throws](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Saving-Throws), skill checks, and ability checks. Shaken is a less severe state of fear than frightened or panicked.

#### Sickened

The character takes a â2 penalty on all attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, [saving throws](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Saving-Throws), skill checks, and ability checks.

#### Sinking

A ship that is reduced to 0 or fewer [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points) gains the sinking condition. A sinking ship cannot move or attack, and it sinks completely 10 rounds after it gains the sinking condition. Each additional hit on a sinking ship that deals more than 25 points of damage reduces the remaining time for it to sink by 1 round. A ship that sinks completely drops to the bottom of the body of water and is considered destroyed. A destroyed ship cannot be repairedâit is so significantly damaged it cannot even be used for scrap material. Magic (such as [make whole](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/m/make-whole)) can repair a sinking ship if the ship’s [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points) are raised above 0, at which point the ship loses the sinking condition. Generally, non-magical repairs take too long to save a ship from sinking once it begins to go down.

#### Stable

A character who was dying but who has stopped losing [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points) each round and still has negative [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points) is stable. The character is no longer dying, but is still unconscious. If the character has become stable because of aid from another character (such as a [Heal](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/heal) check or magical healing), then the character no longer loses [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points). The character can make a DC 10 [Constitution](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-) check each hour to become conscious and disabled (even though his [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points) are still negative). The character takes a penalty on this roll equal to his negative hit point total.

If a character has become stable on his own and hasn’t had help, he is still at risk of losing [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points). Each hour he can make a [Constitution](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-) check to become stable (as a character that has received aid), but each failed check causes him to lose 1 hit point.

#### Staggered

A staggered creature may take a single [move action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Move-Actions) or [standard action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions) each round (but not both, nor can he take full-round actions). A staggered creature can still take free, swift, and immediate actions. A creature with [nonlethal damage](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Nonlethal-Damage) exactly equal to its current [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points) gains the staggered condition.

#### Stunned

A stunned creature drops everything held, can’t take actions, takes a â2 penalty to [AC](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Armor-Class), and loses its [Dexterity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-) bonus to [AC](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Armor-Class) (if any).

Attackers receive a +4 bonus on attack rolls to perform [combat maneuvers](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuvers) against a stunned opponent.

#### Unconscious

Unconscious creatures are knocked out and helpless. Unconsciousness can result from having negative [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points) (but not more than the creature’s [Constitution](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-) score), or from [nonlethal damage](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Nonlethal-Damage) in excess of current [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points).

### Conditions from other Publishers

#### Antagonized

**Source** : [Psychological Combat](http://www.opengamingstore.com/collections/everyman-gaming-llc/products/psychological-combat)

An antagonized creature can only target its antagonist (the one who caused the antagonized condition) with hostile actions. A hostile action is any attack or effect that causes direct harm to an opponent in the form of damage, negative conditions, or any other effect that penalizes or hinders a creature. Furthermore, an antagonized creature does not threaten any opponents except its antagonist: it cannot make [attacks of opportunity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity) or be used to determine [flanking](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Flanking) bonuses against other opponents. A creature is no longer antagonized if its antagonist is helpless, unconscious, or cannot participate in combat. If an antagonized creature uses an ability that targets multiple creatures, the antagonist must be chosen among these targets. If an antagonized creature uses an ability that targets an area, its antagonist must be within the ability’s targeted area.

On each round after the first, an antagonized creature may attempt a [Sense Motive](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/sense-motive) skill check to realize the folly of its actions during its turn as a [swift action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions). This skill check is opposed by the antagonist’s original antagonize skill check. If the creature succeeds on its [Sense Motive](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/sense-motive) skill check, the antagonized condition ends, but the creature suffers a -2 penalty on [attack rolls](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll) and a -2 penalty to the saving throw DC of its abilities and any spells it casts for 1 minute. These penalties do not apply against the antagonist.

#### Asleep

**Source** [Everyman Minis: Sleeping Rules](https://www.opengamingstore.com/products/everyman-minis-sleeping-rules) by Rogue Genius Games

A character who is asleep is resting and helpless.

An asleep character can be awoken by an ally as a standard action (a special application of the [aid another](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Aid-Another) action) or from being wounded. While asleep, a character takes a â10 penalty on [Perception](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perception) checks and cannot attempt [Perception](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perception) checks that rely on vision, but she can otherwise attempt reactive [Perception](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perception) checks to notice changes in her environment that do not rely on sight. For instance, a sleeping character can attempt a [Perception](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perception) check to hear a loud noise, smell a terrible odor, or sense a creature [burrow](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/monsters-foes/#Burrow)ing in the earth beneath her. If a sleeping character succeeds at a [Perception](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perception) check to notice such a change, she automatically awakens.

Asleep is a more severe state of sleepiness than drowsy.

#### Driven

**Source** : [PSCS](http://www.opengamingstore.com/collections/icosa-entertainment-llc/products/pure-steam-campaign-setting "PSCS")

A creature that has [immunity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Immunity-Ex-or-Su-) to mind-affecting effects is also immune to the Driven condition. Subjects under this condition gain the following:

  * You are considered [flat-footed](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Flat-Footed).
  * You lose your [move action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Move-Actions) for the turn.
  * At the start of your turn, the creature that caused this condition can force you to move using one of your movement modes as a [free action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions). The creature chooses the direction and distance of the movement.
  * This movement does not provoke [attacks of opportunity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity).



#### Drowsy

**Source** [Everyman Minis: Sleeping Rules](https://www.opengamingstore.com/products/everyman-minis-sleeping-rules) by Rogue Genius Games

A character who is drowsy is half-awake and inattentive, but otherwise able to act normally. A drowsy character takes a penalty on all ability checks and skill checks, as well as on [initiative](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Initiative) checks, [concentration](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Concentration) checks, [Reflex](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex) saves, and [Will](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will) saves. This penalty is equal to â2 for mild drowsiness, â4 for moderate drowsiness, or â8 for extreme drowsiness. In addition, a character with moderate drowsiness has a 25% spell failure chance with all spells she casts, while a character with severe drowsiness has a 50% spell failure chance with all spells she casts and cannot regain spells. Characters with moderate drowsiness or severe drowsiness must attempt a DC 10 [Wisdom](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-) check or fall asleep for 1d10 minutes. A moderately drowsy character must attempt this check once every 30 minutes, while a severely drowsy character must attempt this check once per minute.

Drowsy is a less severe state of sleepiness than asleep.

Multiple applications of the drowsy condition stack to create a more severe level of drowsiness: A mildly drowsy character who is made mildly drowsy again becomes moderately drowsy, a mildly drowsy character who is made moderately drowsy becomes severely drowsy, and a mildly drowsy character who becomes severely drowsy becomes asleep. A moderately drowsy character who is made moderately drowsy again becomes severely drowsy, and a moderately drowsy character who becomes severely drowsy becomes asleep. A severely drowsy character who becomes severely drowsy again becomes asleep.

#### Necrosis

**Source** LV ([Necromancer of the Northwest](https://www.opengamingstore.com/collections/necromancers-of-the-northwest))

The following section describes necrosis, a new condition which affects only creatures with the [undead](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead) type.

Necrosis represents the effects of severing an [undead](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead) creature from the magical energy that animates it. This causes the [undead](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead) creature to have less control over its body, which is made weaker as a result. [Incorporeal](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Incorporeal-Ex-) [undead](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead) are immune to necrosis. Necrosis comes in two stages: light necrosis, and severe necrosis.

**Light Necrosis** : A character under the effects of light necrosis can neither run nor [charge](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Charge), and suffers a -2 penalty to [Strength](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-) and [Dexterity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-). Additionally, characters suffering from light necrosis suffer half again as much damage (150%) as they normally would from positive energy, or any other damage which specifically applies only to [undead](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead) creatures. Anything that would normally cause light necrosis causes the necrotic character to suffer severe necrosis, instead. Once the source of the light necrosis has been removed, the character still suffers from its effects for one hour before the condition is completely cured.

**Severe Necrosis** : A character suffering from severe necrosis moves at half speed, cannot run or [charge](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Charge), and suffers a -6 penalty to [Strength](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-) and [Dexterity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-), as well as a -4 penalty on saving throws. Additionally, characters suffering from severe necrosis suffer twice as much damage (200%) as they normally would from positive energy, or any other damage which specifically applies only to [undead](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead) creatures. Once the source of the severe necrosis has been removed, the character still suffers from its effects for ten minutes, after which he suffers from light necrosis, instead.

##### Sidebar: Other Uses for Necrosis

Necrosis, as a phenomenon, can apply to all corporeal [undead](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead), not just revenants and other forms of [vampires](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/vampire/vampire). The following suggestions are various ways that you can use necrosis to handle situations that can arise with corporeal [undead](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead) in your game. Each of these suggestions is an entirely optional variant rule, and GMs are encouraged to pick and choose which ones feel right to them and which ones donât.

  * Whenever a corporeal [undead](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead) creature enters an anti-magic field, it is immediately afflicted with light necrosis. If it remains in the field for more than 10 minutes, it suffers from severe necrosis, instead.
  * Corporeal [undead](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead) that fail a saving throw to resist a [clericâs](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric) [channel energy](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric#TOC-Channel-Energy-Su-) class feature or the [Turn Undead](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/turn-undead) feat by more than 5 suffer from light necrosis, in addition to the normal effects of failing the saving throw.
  * Corporeal [undead](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead) in an area affected by the [consecrate](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/c/consecrate) spell do not suffer the minor [disruption](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/disruption) mentioned in the spellâs description. Instead, they gain the light necrosis condition. If they spend 10 minutes or more in the affected area, they suffer from severe necrosis, instead.
  * Undead that were created by [animate dead](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/a/animate-dead), or a similar spell, begin to suffer from light necrosis 2d4 days after their creator stops controlling them (such as if he is slain, or if he chooses to release them in order to control other [undead](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Undead) creatures). After 2d4 weeks, they suffer from severe necrosis, instead. These conditions last indefinitely, but if the affected creature regains any [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points) as a result of negative energy (such as an evil [clericâs](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric) [channel energy](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric#TOC-Channel-Energy-Su-) ability, or an [inflict light wounds](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/i/inflict-light-wounds) spell), the necrosis is immediately cured (although the cycle begins again 2d4 days later).
