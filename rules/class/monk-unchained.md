# Unchained Monk

For the truly exemplary, martial skill transcends the battlefield—it is a lifestyle, a doctrine, a state of mind. These warrior-artists search out methods of battle beyond swords and shields, finding weapons within themselves just as capable of crippling or killing as any blade. These monks (so called since they adhere to ancient philosophies and strict martial disciplines) elevate their bodies to become weapons of war, from battle-minded ascetics to self-taught brawlers. Monks tread the path of discipline, and those with the will to endure that path discover within themselves not what they are, but what they are meant to be.

**Role** : Monks excel at overcoming even the most daunting perils, striking where it’s least expected, and taking advantage of enemy vulnerabilities. Fleet of foot and skilled in combat, monks can navigate any battlefield with ease, aiding allies wherever they are needed most.

**Unchained** : Much of the monk has been reworked, including its base attack bonus, Hit Die, saves, and many of its special abilities. The result is a version of the monk that not only is easier to play, but also possesses a great deal more versatility. Flurry of blows is now much simpler to use in play. Many of the higher-level abilities of the monk, such as abundant step and quivering palm, have been incorporated into the new system of _ki_ powers. As a monk advances in level, he can select from a variety of _ki_ powers, allowing the player to truly customize his character.

**Alignment** : Any lawful

**Hit Die** : d10.

**Starting Wealth** : 1d6 × 10 gp (average 35 gp.) In addition, each character begins play with an outfit worth 10 gp or less.

### Class Features

All of the following are class features of the monk.

#### Weapon and Armor Proficiency

Monks are proficient with the club, crossbow (light or heavy), dagger, handaxe, javelin, kama, nunchaku, quarterstaff, sai, short sword, shortspear, shuriken, siangham, sling, spear, and any weapon with the monk special weapon quality.

Monks are not proficient with any armor or shields.

When wearing armor, using a shield, or carrying a medium or heavy load, a monk loses his AC bonus, as well as his fast movement and flurry of blows abilities.

#### AC Bonus

When unarmored and unencumbered, the monk adds his Wisdom bonus (if any) to his AC and CMD. In addition, a monk gains a +1 bonus to AC and CMD at 4th level. This bonus increases by 1 for every four monk levels thereafter, up to a maximum of +5 at 20th level.

These bonuses to AC apply even against touch attacks or when the monk is flat-footed. He loses these bonuses when he is immobilized or helpless, when he wears any armor, when he carries a shield, or when he carries a medium or heavy load.

#### Bonus Feat

At 1st level, 2nd level, and every 4 levels thereafter, a monk can select a bonus feat. These feats must be taken from the following list:

Catch Off-Guard, Combat Reflexes, Deflect Arrows, Dodge, Improved Grapple, Scorpion Style, and Throw Anything.

At 6th level, the following feats are added to the list:

Gorgon’s Fist, Improved Bull Rush, Improved Disarm, Improved Feint, Improved Trip, and Mobility.

At 10th level, the following feats are added to the list:

Improved Critical, Medusa’s Wrath, Snatch Arrows, and Spring Attack.

A monk need not have any of the prerequisites normally required for these feats to select them.

#### Flurry of Blows

At 1st level, a monk can make a flurry of blows as a full-attack action. When making a flurry of blows, the monk can make one additional attack at his highest base attack bonus. This additional attack stacks with the bonus attacks from haste and other similar effects. When using this ability, the monk can make these attacks with any combination of his unarmed strikes and weapons that have the monk special weapon quality. He takes no penalty for using multiple weapons when making a flurry of blows, but he does not gain any additional attacks beyond what’s already granted by the flurry for doing so. (He can still gain additional attacks from a high base attack bonus, from this ability, and from haste and similar effects).

At 11th level, a monk can make an additional attack at his highest base attack bonus whenever he makes a flurry of blows. This stacks with the first attack from this ability and additional attacks from haste and similar effects.

#### Stunning Fist

At 1st level, the monk gains Stunning Fist as a bonus feat, even if he does not meet the prerequisites.

At 4th level, and every 4 levels thereafter, the monk gains the ability to apply a new condition to the target of his Stunning Fist. This condition replaces stunning the target for 1 round, and a successful saving throw still negates the effect.

At 4th level, the monk can choose to make the target fatigued. At 8th level, he can make the target sickened for 1 minute.

At 12th level, he can make the target staggered for 1d6+1 rounds.

At 16th level, he can permanently blind or deafen the target.

At 20th level, he can paralyze the target for 1d6+1 rounds. The monk must choose which condition will apply before the attack roll is made. These effects do not stack with themselves (a creature fatigued by Stunning Fist cannot become exhausted if hit by Stunning Fist again), but additional hits do increase the duration.

#### Unarmed Strike

Table: Small or Large Monk Natural Damage Level | Small Monk Damage | Large Monk Damage)  
---|---|---  
1st–3rd | 1d4 | 1d8  
4th–7th | 1d6 | 2d6  
8th–11th | 1d8 | 2d8  
12th–15th | 1d10 | 3d6  
16th–19th | 2d6 | 3d8  
20th | 2d8 | 4d8  
  
At 1st level, a monk gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. A monk’s attacks can be with fists, elbows, knees, and feet. This means that a monk can make unarmed strikes with his hands full. There is no such thing as an off-hand attack for a monk striking unarmed. A monk can apply his full Strength bonus on damage rolls for all his unarmed strikes. A monk’s unarmed strikes deal lethal damage, although he can choose to deal nonlethal damage with no penalty on his attack roll. He can make this choice while grappling as well.

A monk’s unarmed strike is treated as both a manufactured weapon and a natural weapon for the purpose of spells and effects that enhance or improve either manufactured weapons or natural weapons.

The damage dealt by a monk’s unarmed strike is determined by the unarmed damage column on **Table: Monk Unchained**. The damage listed is for Medium monks.

The damage for Small or Large monks is listed below.

#### Evasion

At 2nd level, a monk can avoid damage from many area-effect attacks. If a monk succeeds at a Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if a monk is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless monk does not gain the benefit of evasion.

#### Fast Movement

At 3rd level, a monk gains an enhancement bonus to his land speed, as shown on **Table: Monk Unchained**. A monk in armor or carrying a medium or heavy load loses this extra speed.

#### _Ki_ Pool (Su)

At 3rd level, a monk gains a pool of _ki_ points, supernatural energy he can use to accomplish amazing feats. The number of points in a monk’s _ki_ pool is equal to 1/2 his monk level + his Wisdom modifier. As long as he has at least 1 point in his _ki_ pool, he can make a _ki_ strike.   
At 3rd level, _ki_ strike allows his unarmed attacks to be treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.   
At 7th level, his unarmed attacks are also treated as cold iron and silver for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.   
At 10th level, his unarmed attacks are also treated as lawful weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.   
At 16th level, his unarmed attacks are treated as adamantine weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction and bypassing hardness.

By spending 1 point from his _ki_ pool as a swift action, a monk can make one additional unarmed strike at his highest attack bonus when making a flurry of blows attack. This bonus attack stacks with all bonus attacks gained from flurry of blows, as well as those from haste and similar effects. A monk gains additional powers that consume points from his _ki_ pool as he gains levels.   
The _ki_ pool is replenished each morning after 8 hours of rest or meditation; these hours do not need to be consecutive.

#### _Ki_ Power (Su)

At 4th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a monk can select one _ki_ power. These powers allow the monk to perform amazing feats of mystical power and acrobatic prowess by expending points from his _ki_ pool. Once a _ki_ power is selected, it cannot be changed. Some _ki_ powers require the monk to be of a specific level or higher before they can be chosen.

Unless otherwise noted, a monk cannot select an individual _ki_ power more than once.

  * _Empty Body (Su)_ : A monk with this _ki_ power gains the ability to assume an ethereal state for 1 minute as though using the spell etherealness, using his monk level as his caster level. Using this ability is a move action that consumes 3 points from the monk’s _ki_ pool. This ability affects only the monk and cannot be used to make other creatures ethereal.
  * _Feather Balance (Ex)_ : A monk with this ability can spend 1 _ki_ point as a swift action to achieve perfect balance. While this is active, the monk treats any Acrobatics attempt made to balance as if he had rolled a 20. This ability lasts for 1 minute.
  * _High Jump (Ex)_ : A monk with this _ki_ power adds his level as a bonus on all Acrobatics checks to jump, both for vertical jumps and horizontal jumps. In addition, he always counts as having a running start when attempting Acrobatics checks to jump. By spending 1 point from his _ki_ pool as a swift action, the monk gains a +20 bonus on Acrobatics checks to jump for 1 round.
  * _Ki Metabolism (Su)_ : A monk with this ability uses his _ki_ to control his metabolism. As long as he has at least 1 point remaining in his _ki_ pool, the monk needs to eat and drink only 1/4 as often as normal, needs only 2 hours of sleep each night (including to replenish his _ki_ pool), and can hold his breath for up to 1 hour per point of Constitution. As a move action, he can spend 1 _ki_ point to enter a state of suspended animation, falling unconscious and appearing dead to all senses. At the time he enters this state, he indicates a preset period of time or a triggering condition, after which he awakens.
  * _Ki Range (Su)_ : A monk with this ability can spend 1 _ki_ point as a swift action to increase the range increment of any thrown monk weapon by 20 feet. Apply this benefit before doubling the range increment with the Far Shot feat.
  * _Ki Sunder (Ex)_ : A monk with this ability can spend 1 _ki_ point as a free action when attempting a sunder combat maneuver check to add his monk level as a bonus to the damage roll. **Source** PPC:MAH
  * _Qinggong Power (Su)_ : A monk with this power selects any of the qinggong monk _ki_ powers for which he qualifies based on his monk level. A monk can select this ability multiple times. Each time, he must select a different qinggong monk _ki_ power.
  * _Slow Fall (Su)_ : A monk within arm’s reach of a wall can use it to slow his descent by expending 1 point from his _ki_ pool. When he uses this ability, he takes no damage from the fall (as if using feather fall), but he must be adjacent to a wall for the length of the fall (although this can be used to reduce the damage from a fall if only part of it is adjacent to a wall).
  * _Sudden Speed (Su)_ : A monk with this _ki_ power can spend 1 point from his _ki_ pool as a swift action to grant himself a sudden burst of speed. This increases the monk’s base land speed by 30 feet for 1 minute.
  * _Wholeness of Body (Su)_ : A monk with this _ki_ power can heal his own wounds as a standard action. By spending 2 points from his _ki_ pool, he can heal an amount of damage equal to 1d8 + his monk level.
  * _Zephyr Blow (Su)_ : By spending 1 ki point as a standard action, a monk with this power can disrupt the wind and create a sharp blast of air, as if using the spell gust of wind. The monk’s caster level for this effect is equal to his monk level. **Source** PPC:WO

  * _Action Before Thought (Ex)_ : A monk with this ability can spend 2 _ki_ points as a free action as part of rolling initiative to roll twice on the initiative check and take the higher result. A monk must be at least 6th level before selecting this _ki_ power. **Source** PPC:MAH

  * _Elemental Fury (Su)_ : A monk who selects this _ki_ power must select one type of energy: acid, cold, electricity, or fire. Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed. The monk can expend 1 point from his _ki_ pool as a swift action to imbue his natural attacks with this energy, causing them to deal 1d6 points of damage of the chosen type for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 his monk level. A monk must be at least 6th level before selecting this _ki_ power.
  * _Ki Guardian (Su)_ : As an immediate action before he rolls a saving throw against a targeted effect that also targets other allies or an area effect whose area includes other allies, a monk with this ability can spend any number of _ki_ points and designate a number of adjacent allies equal to the number of _ki_ points spent. The monk rolls one saving throw for each designated ally, using his bonus instead of the ally’s. For each successful saving throw, the corresponding ally treats the effect as if that ally had succeeded at the saving throw, and for each saving throw failed, the corresponding ally treats the effect as if that ally had failed the saving throw. If the monk fails any of the saving throws (including his own original saving throw), the monk treats the effect as if he had failed the saving throw. A monk must be at least 6th level before selecting this _ki_ power.
  * _Ki Mount (Su)_ : A monk with this ability can spend 1 _ki_ point as a standard action to grant 2 temporary hit points per monk level he possesses to his mount for 1 hour per monk level. As long as the monk and his mount are adjacent or the monk is mounted, the mount shares the benefits of whichever of the AC bonus, evasion, high jump, improved evasion, _ki_ strike, perfect self, and still mind abilities the monk possesses.

##### 7th level required:

  * _Formless Mastery (Ex)_ : A monk with this ability varies his styles, never repeating the same move twice and capitalizing on the weaknesses of an opponent’s style. As long as he does not possess any style feat, the monk can spend 1 point from his _ki_ pool as an immediate action to gain the following against opponents in the stance of a style feat: a +4 dodge bonus to AC, a +4 circumstance bonus on attack rolls, and a bonus equal to his monk level on damage rolls. These bonuses last until the end of the monk’s next turn (or his current turn if he uses this ability on his own turn). The monk can activate this ability and the furious defense _ki_ power with the same immediate action for a total cost of 3 _ki_ points. A monk must be at least 7th level before selecting this _ki_ power.

He can spend an additional 1 _ki_ point when using this ability to activate _ki_ sunder as a free action. A monk must be at least 8th level and have the _ki_ sunder _ki_ power before selecting this _ki_ power. **Source** PPC:MAH
  * _Breaking-Down Koan (Su)_ : A monk with this ability can spend 1 _ki_ point as a swift action to present a paradox, riddle, or complicated question to a creature within 30 feet. The creature must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the monk’s level + his Wisdom modifier) or be confused for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting, language-dependent effect. A monk must be at least 8th level before selecting this _ki_ power. **Source** PPC:MAH
  * _Building-Up Koan (Su)_ : A monk with this ability can spend 2 _ki_ points as a swift action to ask himself a koan, which he then tries to answer.

  * _Insightful Wisdom (Su)_ : A monk with this ability can spend 2 _ki_ points as an immediate action to give another ally within 30 feet just the right word of advice to prevent disaster.

A monk must be at least 8th level before selecting this _ki_ power.
  * _Light Steps (Ex)_ : A monk with this _ki_ power can move effortlessly across nearly any surface.

If the monk spends 2 points from his _ki_ pool, he can use this ability to affect the target’s arcane pool, arcane reservoir, grit points, inspiration, or panache points instead of its _ki_ pool. The effects of this ability do not stack, but multiple hits increase the duration by 1 hour for each hit. A monk must be at least 10th level before selecting this _ki_ power.
  * _Ki Hurricane (Ex)_ : As a full-round action, a monk with this ability can move up to twice his speed. At any point in that movement, the monk can spend 1 _ki_ point to make the first attack in his flurry of blows.

A monk must be at least 10th level and possess the sudden speed _ki_ power before selecting this _ki_ power.
  * _Ki Visions (Su)_ : A monk with this ability often sees visions of spirits or hears the voice of his departed mentor in his dreams.

A monk must be at least 10th level before selecting this _ki_ power.



##### 12th level required:

  * _Cobra Breath (Su)_ : Whenever a monk with this _ki_ power uses diamond body to neutralize a poison, he can instead release that poison as a ranged touch attack against a single foe within 30 feet. If the attack hits, the foe must succeed at a saving throw (using the poison’s original DC) or suffer the poison’s effects, even if it was not originally a contact poison. A monk must be at least 12th level and must possess the diamond body _ki_ power before selecting this _ki_ power.
  * _Diamond Resilience (Ex)_ : By spending 1 _ki_ point as a swift action, the monk gains DR 2/—. At 16th level, the damage reduction increases to 4/—. At 19th level, it increases to DR 6/—. This DR lasts for 1 minute. A monk must be at least 12th level before selecting this _ki_ power.
  * _Diamond Soul (Ex)_ : A monk can spend 2 points from his _ki_ pool as a swift action to gain spell resistance equal to his monk level + 10. This spell resistance lasts for a number of rounds equal to the monk’s level. A monk must be at least 12th level before selecting this _ki_ power.
  * _Master-Thought Koan (Su)_ : A monk with this ability can spend an additional 2 _ki_ points when using either the breaking-down koan or building-up koan _ki_ powers. When combined with master-thought koan, breaking-down koan affects a number of characters of your choice within 30 feet equal to the monk’s wisdom modifier. When combined with master-thought koan, building-up koan can be used on an ally within 30 feet. A monk must be at least 12th level and have either the breaking-down koan or the building-up koan _ki_ power before selecting this _ki_ power. **Source** PPC:MAH
  * _One Touch (Ex)_ : As long as he has at least 1 point remaining in his _ki_ pool, as a standard action, a monk with this power can make an unarmed strike against a foe as a touch attack. He adds 1/2 his monk level as a bonus on the damage roll. He can spend 1 _ki_ point to double this bonus for that attack. A monk must be at least 12th level before selecting this _ki_ power.



##### 16th level required:

  * _Ki Volley (Su)_ : When a targeted spell or spell-like ability fails to overcome the monk’s spell resistance from diamond soul, he can spend 2 _ki_ points as an immediate action to send that spell back at its caster as spell turning. A monk must be 16th level or higher and possess the diamond soul _ki_ power before selecting this _ki_ power.
  * _Quivering Palm (Su)_ : A monk can set up vibrations within the body of another creature that can thereafter be fatal if the monk so desires. Using this ability is a standard action that costs 4 _ki_ points, and the monk must announce his intent to use this ability (and spend the _ki_ points) before making the attack roll. Creatures immune to critical hits cannot be affected. Otherwise, if the attack hits and the target takes damage from the blow, the quivering palm attack succeeds. Thereafter, the monk can try to slay the victim at any time within a number of days equal to his monk level. To make such an attempt, the monk merely wills the target to die (a free action); unless the target succeeds at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 the monk’s level + the monk’s Wisdom modifier), it dies. If the saving throw is successful, the target is no longer in danger from that particular quivering palm attack, but it can still be affected by another one at a later time. A monk can have no more than one quivering palm in effect at one time. If a monk uses quivering palm while another is still in effect, the previous one is negated. A monk must be at least 16th level before selecting this _ki_ power.



##### 18th level required:

  * _Elemental Burst (Su)_ : A monk with this ability can spend 4 _ki_ points to unleash a gout of energy in a 30-foot cone. Creatures within the cone take 20d6 points of damage of the same type as the monk’s elemental fury _ki_ power. A Reflex save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the monk’s level + his Wisdom modifier) halves the damage. A monk must be at least 18th level and must possess the elemental fury _ki_ power before selecting this _ki_ power.



#### Still Mind (Ex)

At 4th level, a monk gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against enchantment spells and effects.

#### Purity of Body (Ex)

At 5th level, a monk gains immunity to all diseases, including supernatural and magical diseases.

#### Style Strike (Ex)

At 5th level, a monk can learn one type of style strike. Whenever he makes a flurry of blows, he can designate one of his unarmed strikes as a style strike. This attack is resolved as normal, but it has an additional effect depending on the type of strike chosen. At 9th level, and every 4 levels thereafter, a monk learns an additional style strike. He must choose which style strike to apply before the attack roll is made. At 15th level, he can designate up to two of his unarmed strikes each round as a style strike, and each one can be a different type. The monk can choose from any of the following strikes.

_Break_ : The monk combines a writhing twist with a violent strike against a foe that is grappling him. If the monk’s attack is successful, he can attempt a grapple combat maneuver check or Escape Artist check as a free action to escape a grapple, adding the strike’s damage as a bonus on his check. **Source** PPC:MAH

_Defensive Spin_ : The monk spins about, confounding his foe. If the attack hits, the monk gains a +4 dodge bonus to AC against any attacks made by the target of the style strike until the start of his next turn. This bonus does not stack with itself. The monk must attack with a fist to use this style strike.

_Elbow Smash_ : The monk follows up a punch with a strike from his elbow. If the attack hits, the monk can make an additional attack using the same attack bonus as the punch at a –5 penalty. If this second attack hits, it deals damage as normal, but all of the damage is nonlethal. The monk must attack with a fist to use this style strike.

_Flying Kick_ : The monk leaps through the air to strike a foe with a kick. Before the attack, the monk can move a distance equal to his fast movement bonus. This movement is made as part of the monk’s flurry of blows attack and does not require an additional action. At the end of this movement, the monk must make an attack against an adjacent foe. This movement may be between attacks. This movement provokes an attack of opportunity as normal. The attack made after the movement must be a kick.

_Foot Stomp_ : The monk stomps on a foe’s foot, preventing the opponent from escaping. If the attack hits and the monk ends his turn adjacent to that foe, the foe’s movement is restricted. Until the start of the monk’s next turn, the target of this attack can move only in such a way that the space it occupies is adjacent to the monk. Alternatively, it can attempt a combat maneuver check (against the monk’s CMD) as a standard action to break free. This strike does not work against foes that cannot be tripped. The monk must attack with a kick to use this style strike.

_Hammerblow_ : The monk links his hands together, swinging both arms like a club and dealing tremendous damage. If the attack hits, the monk rolls his unarmed strike damage twice, adding both rolls together before applying Strength and other modifiers to the damage. This bonus damage is not multiplied on a critical hit. The monk must attack with a fist to use this style strike, but must have both hands free.

_Head-Butt_ : The monk slams his head into his enemy’s head, leaving his foe reeling. If the attack hits and the foe is of the same size or one size smaller than the monk, the monk can make a free combat maneuver check against the target of this strike (using the base attack bonus of the attack used to hit the foe). If the foe is not of the same creature type as the monk, the monk takes a –8 penalty on this check. If the check is successful, the target is staggered for 1 round. Creatures without a discernible head are not affected by this style strike (subject to GM discretion). The monk must attack with a head-butt to use this style strike.

_Knockback Kick_ : The monk attempts to knock his foe back with a powerful kick. If the attack hits, the monk can attempt a free combat maneuver check against the foe (using the base attack bonus of the attack used to hit the foe). If the check is successful, the foe is knocked 10 feet directly away from the monk. This distance increases by 10 feet for every 5 by which the check exceeds the foe’s CMD, to a maximum distance equal to the monk’s fast movement bonus. This movement does not provoke an attack of opportunity. The foe stops moving if it strikes another creature, barrier, or otherwise solid object. The creature is not knocked prone by this movement. The monk must attack with a kick to use this style strike.

_Leg Sweep_ : The monk attempts to sweep his foe’s leg, knocking the opponent down. If the attack hits, the monk can make a free trip attempt against the target of this strike (using the base attack bonus of the attack used to hit the foe). This trip attempt does not provoke an attack of opportunity. The monk must attack with a kick to use this style strike.

_Rabbit Punch_ : The monk gives a sharp blow to the back of a foe’s head. The critical threat range and critical multiplier of this strike increase by 1, and the monk gains a +2 bonus on attack rolls to confirm a critical hit with this strike. This increase is not doubled by Improved Critical or similar effects. Creatures without a discernible head are unaffected by this style strike (subject to GM discretion). The monk must attack with a fist to use this style strike. **Source** PPC:MAH

_Shattering Punch_ : The monk delivers a brutal punch that can penetrate defenses. If the attack hits, it bypasses any damage reduction or hardness possessed by the target of that attack. The monk must attack with a fist to use this style strike.

_Spin Kick_ : The monk spins about, delivering a kick his foe did not expect. The monk makes his attack against the foe’s flat-footed AC. Creatures with the uncanny dodge class feature or a similar effect cannot be caught flat-footed by this style strike. The monk must attack with a kick to use this style strike.

_Throat Crush_ : The monk gives a sharp blow to a foe’s throat, hampering its ability to speak for 1 round as if it had the caster croak spellblight. Creatures without a discernible throat, or with multiple vocal organs, are unaffected (subject to GM discretion). **Source** PPC:MAH

#### Improved Evasion (Ex)

At 9th level, a monk’s evasion ability improves. He still takes no damage on successful Reflex saving throws against attacks, but henceforth he takes only half damage on failed saves. A helpless monk does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.

#### Tongue of the Sun and Moon (Ex)

At 13th level, a monk can understand and speak with any living creature, as if under a permanent tongues effect.

#### Timeless Body (Ex)

At 17th level, a monk no longer takes penalties to his ability scores for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any such penalties that he has already taken, however, remain in place. Age bonuses still accrue, and the monk still dies of old age when his time is up.

#### Flawless Mind

At 19th level, a monk gains total control over his mental faculties. Whenever he attempts a Will save, he can roll twice and take the better result. If he fails a Will saving throw against a spell or effect that has a duration longer than 1 hour, the monk can attempt a new saving throw at the end of each hour to end the effect.

#### Perfect Self

At 20th level, a monk becomes a magical creature. He is forevermore treated as an outsider rather than a humanoid (or whatever his original creature type was) for the purpose of spells and magical effects. Additionally, the monk gains damage reduction 10/chaotic, which allows him to ignore the first 10 points of damage from any attack made by a nonchaotic weapon. Unlike other outsiders, the monk can still be brought back from the dead as if he were a member of his previous creature type. Finally, the monk gains the ability to enter a state of perfect calm. During this time, the monk can take no actions, but he does regain _ki_ at the rate of 1 point per 10 minutes spent at calm. He cannot use this ability to gain an amount of _ki_ in excess of his maximum.

### Alternative Capstone Ability

**Source** PPC:CoL

When a character reaches the 20th level of a class, she gains a powerful class feature or ability, sometimes referred to as a capstone. When a character reaches 20th level in this class, the following new ability can be selected instead of the standard 20th level class ability which would normally be gained. In some cases, a capstone specifies what ability it replaces. A character can’t select an alternative capstone if she has previously traded away her class capstone via an archetype. Clerics and wizards can receive a capstone at 20th level, despite not having one to begin with.

#### Old Master (Ex)

At 20th level, the monk has reached the highest levels of his martial arts school. The monk gains one additional attack at his highest base attack bonus when using flurry of blows, and his dodge bonus to AC increases by 2.

## Ex-Monks

A monk who becomes nonlawful cannot gain new levels as a monk but retains all monk abilities.
