While many warriors strive to perfect their art, spending all of their time honing their skill at martial arms, others spend as much effort dedicating themselves to a cause. These warriors, known as cavaliers, swear themselves to a purpose, serving it above all else. Cavaliers are skilled at fighting from horseback, and are often found charging across a battlefield, with the symbol of their order trailing on a long, fluttering banner. The cavalier’s true power comes from the conviction of his ideals, the oaths that he swears, and the challenges he makes.

**Role** : Cavaliers tend to marshal forces on the battlefield, using their mounted talents and challenges to control the flow of the fight. Outside of battle, cavaliers can be found advancing their cause through diplomacy and, if needed, subterfuge. The cavalier is no stranger to courtly intrigue and can hold his own in even the most delicate of social situations.

**Alignment** : Any.

**Hit Dice** : d10.

**Starting Wealth** : 5d6 × 10 gp (average 175gp.) In addition, each character begins play with an outfit worth 10 gp or less.

### Class Skills

The cavalier’s class skills are Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis), and Swim (Str).

**Skill Ranks per Level** : 4 + Int modifier.

### Class Features

The following are the class features of the cavalier.

#### Weapon and Armor Proficiency

Cavaliers are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, with all types of armor (heavy, light, and medium) and with shields (except tower shields).

#### Challenge (Ex)

Once per day, a cavalier can challenge a foe to combat. As a swift action, the cavalier chooses one target within sight to challenge. The cavalier’s melee attacks deal extra damage whenever the attacks are made against the target of his challenge. This extra damage is equal to the cavalier’s level. The cavalier can use this ability once per day at 1st level, plus one additional time per day for every three levels beyond 1st, to a maximum of seven times per day at 19th level.

Challenging a foe requires much of the cavalier’s concentration. The cavalier takes a –2 penalty to his Armor Class, except against attacks made by the target of his challenge.

The challenge remains in effect until the target is dead or unconscious or until the combat ends. Each cavalier’s challenge also includes another effect which is listed in the section describing the cavalier’s order.

#### Mount (Ex)

FAQ

**Do animal companion levels from the druid class stack with cavalier mount levels?**

If the animal is on the cavalier mount list and on the list of animal companions for your other class, your cavalier and druid levels stack to determine the animal’s abilities. If the animal is not on the cavalier mount list, the druid levels do not stack and you must have different animals (one an animal companion, one a cavalier mount).

For example, if you are Medium druid and you choose a horse companion, levels in cavalier stack to determine the horse’s abilities. If you are a Medium druid and you choose a bird companion, levels in cavalier do not stack to determine the bird’s abilities, and you must choose a second creature to be your mount (or abandon the bird and select an animal companion you can use as a mount).

This same answer applies to multi-classed cavalier/rangers.

(Note that the design team discourages players from having more than one companion creature at a time, as those creatures tend to be much weaker than a single creature affected by these stacking rules, and add to the bookkeeping for playing that character.)

[Source]

A cavalier gains the service of a loyal and trusty steed to carry him into battle. This mount functions as a druid’s animal companion, using the cavalier’s level as his effective druid level. The creature must be one that he is capable of riding and is suitable as a mount.

A Medium cavalier can select an axebeakPPC:WO, camelPPC:WO, elkPPC:WO, giant seahorsePPC:WO, giant tortoisePPC:WO, horse, giraffePPC:WO, or a zebraPZO1140 as a mount.

A Small cavalier can select an antelopePPC:WO, a capybaraPZO1140, giant weaselPPC:WO, lizard (giant gecko)PPC:WO, kangarooPPC:WO, pony, ramPPC:WO, reindeerPZO1140, stagPPC:WO, wolfPZO1140 or wolfdog as a mount but can also select a boarPZO1140 or a dogPZO1140 if he is at least 4th level. The GM might approve other animals as suitable mounts.

The augmented companion, bodyguard, bully, daredevil, draconic, racer, and wrecker companion archetypes are all particularly appropriate for a cavalier’s mount.

A cavalier does not take an armor check penalty on Ride checks while riding his mount. The mount is always considered combat trained and begins play with Light Armor Proficiency as a bonus feat. A cavalier’s mount does not gain the share spells special ability.

A cavalier’s bond with his mount is strong, with the pair learning to anticipate each other’s moods and moves. Should a cavalier’s mount die, the cavalier may find another mount to serve him after 1 week of mourning. This new mount does not gain the link, evasion, devotion, or improved evasion special abilities until the next time the cavalier gains a level.

#### Order (Ex)

At 1st level, a cavalier must pledge himself to a specific order. The order grants the cavalier a number of bonuses, class skills, and special abilities. In addition, each order includes a number of edicts that the cavalier must follow. If he violates any of these edicts, he loses the benefits from his order’s challenge ability for 24 hours. The violation of an edict is subject to GM interpretation. A cavalier cannot change his order without undertaking a lengthy process to dedicate himself to a new cause. When this choice is made, he immediately loses all of the benefits from his old order. He must then follow the edicts of his new order for one entire level without gaining any benefits from that order. Once accomplished, he gains all of the bonuses from his new order. Note that the names of these orders might vary depending upon the campaign setting or GM’s preference.

The following orders can be chosen by both cavaliers and samurai.

Members of these orders are not necessarily bound together, but some organizations do exist that are comprised of cavaliers that all belong to one specific order.

#### Tactician (Ex)

At 1st level, a cavalier receives a teamwork feat as a bonus feat. He must meet the prerequisites for this feat. As a standard action, the cavalier can grant this feat to all allies within 30 feet who can see and hear him. Allies retain the use of this bonus feat for 3 rounds plus 1 round for every two levels the cavalier possesses. Allies do not need to meet the prerequisites of these bonus feats. The cavalier can use this ability once per day at 1st level, plus one additional time per day at 5th level and for every 5 levels thereafter.

#### Cavalier’s Charge (Ex)

At 3rd level, a cavalier learns to make more accurate charge attacks while mounted. The cavalier receives a +4 bonus on melee attack rolls on a charge while mounted (instead of the normal +2). In addition, the cavalier does not suffer any penalty to his AC after making a charge attack while mounted.

#### Expert Trainer (Ex)

At 4th level, a cavalier learns to train mounts with speed and unsurpassed expertise. The cavalier receives a bonus equal to 1/2 his cavalier level whenever he uses Handle Animal on an animal that serves as a mount. In addition, he can reduce the time needed to teach a mount a new trick or train a mount for a general purpose to 1 day per 1 week required by increasing the DC by +5. He can also train more than one mount at once, although each mount after the first adds +2 to the DC.

#### Banner (Ex)

At 5th level, a cavalier’s banner becomes a symbol of inspiration to his allies and companions. As long as the cavalier’s banner is clearly visible, all allies within 60 feet receive a +2 morale bonus on saving throws against fear and a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls made as part of a charge. At 10th level, and every five levels thereafter, these bonuses increase by +1. The banner must be at least Small or larger and must be carried or displayed by the cavalier or his mount to function.

##### Alternate Banner Options

**Source** PPC:CoL

Some knights inspire and direct their allies with specialized tactics. A cavalier can select one of the following battle standards upon gaining the banner class feature, and its benefits replace the normal benefits of the banner and greater banner class features. A battle standard functions as the banner or greater banner class feature except where otherwise noted. A cavalier who replaces the banner or greater banner class feature via an archetype cannot select a battle standard, with the following exception: a standard bearer cavalier can select a battle standard at 1st level, and its effects increase as per the standard bearer’s banner.

  * **Fleet Standard (Ex)** An ally who benefits from this standard increases her land speed by 5 feet and gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC during any round in which she moved at least 10 feet. This increase to land speed is an enhancement bonus. At 10th level and every 5 levels thereafter, the bonus to speed increases by 5 feet. At 14th level, an ally benefiting from the banner gains a +2 morale bonus on Reflex saving throws against effects that target an area, such as fireball or breath weapons. When the cavalier waves this standard, each ally within 60 feet can move up to her speed as an immediate action.
  * **Jinx Standard (Ex)** These grim fetishes are common among some cavaliers. An ally who benefits from this standard gains a +1 bonus on caster level checks to bypass spell resistance and a +1 bonus to the DC of her hexes and necromancy or enchantment spell she casts. At 10th level and every 5 levels thereafter, the bonus on caster level checks increases by 1. At 14th level, an ally benefiting from the banner gains a +2 morale bonus on saving throws against spells or effects that deal hit point damage. When the cavalier waves this standard, a number of allies equal to the cavalier Charisma modifier (minimum 1) within 60 feet can attempt an Intimidate check to demoralize a foe as an immediate action.
  * **Knave Standard (Ex)** An ally who benefits from this standard gains a +2 dodge bonus to AC against attacks of opportunity provoked by movement and a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls that benefit from flanking. At 10th level and every 5 levels thereafter, the bonus to AC increases by 1. At 14th level, an ally benefiting from the banner gains sneak attack +1d6; this stacks with other sources of sneak attack. When the cavalier waves this standard, a number of allies equal to the cavalier’s Charisma modifier (minimum 1) within 60 feet can each attempt a feint against a foe she threatens as an immediate action.
  * **Stalwart Standard (Ex)** An ally who benefits from this standard gains a +2 morale bonus to CMD and a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls to creatures threatening an ally. At 10th level and every 5 levels thereafter, the bonus to CMD increases by +1. At 14th level, an ally benefiting from the banner is treated as one size category larger for the purposes of determining which creatures can affect him with combat maneuvers. When the cavalier waves this standard, each ally within 60 feet can move up to 10 feet without provoking attacks of opportunities and ignoring difficult terrain as an immediate action.



#### Bonus Feat

At 6th level, and at every six levels thereafter, a cavalier gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement. These bonus feats must be selected from those listed as combat feats. The cavalier must meet the prerequisites of these bonus feats.

#### Greater Tactician (Ex)

At 9th level, the cavalier receives an additional teamwork feat as a bonus feat. He must meet the prerequisites for this feat. The cavalier can grant this feat to his allies using the tactician ability. Using the tactician ability is a swift action.

#### Mighty Charge (Ex)

At 11th level, a cavalier learns to make devastating charge attacks while mounted. Double the threat range of any weapons wielded during a charge while mounted. This increase does not stack with other effects that increase the threat range of the weapon. In addition, the cavalier can make a free bull rush, disarm, sunder, or trip combat maneuver if his charge attack is successful. This free combat maneuver does not provoke an attack of opportunity.

#### Demanding Challenge (Ex)

At 12th level, whenever a cavalier declares a challenge, his target must pay attention to the threat he poses. As long as the target is within the threatened area of the cavalier, it takes a –2 penalty to its AC from attacks made by anyone other than the cavalier.

#### Greater Banner (Ex)

At 14th level, the cavalier’s banner becomes a rallying call to his allies. All allies within 60 feet receive a +2 morale bonus on saving throws against charm and compulsion spells and effects. In addition, while his banner is displayed, the cavalier can spend a standard action to wave the banner through the air, granting all allies within 60 feet an additional saving throw against any one spell or effect that is targeting them. This save is made at the original DC. Spells and effects that do not allow saving throws are unaffected by this ability. An ally cannot benefit from this ability more than once per day.

#### Master Tactician (Ex)

At 17th level, the cavalier receives an additional teamwork feat as a bonus feat. He must meet the prerequisites for this feat. The cavalier can grant this feat to his allies using the tactician ability. Whenever the cavalier uses the tactician ability, he grants any two teamwork feats that he knows. He can select from any of his teamwork feats, not just his bonus feats.

#### Supreme Charge (Ex)

At 20th level, whenever the cavalier makes a charge attack while mounted, he deals double the normal amount of damage (or triple if using a lance). In addition, if the cavalier confirms a critical hit on a charge attack while mounted, the target is stunned for 1d4 rounds. A Will save reduces this to staggered for 1d4 rounds. The DC is equal to 10 + the cavalier’s base attack bonus.

### Alternative Capstone Ability

**Source** PPC:CoL

When a character reaches the 20th level of a class, she gains a powerful class feature or ability, sometimes referred to as a capstone. When a character reaches 20th level in this class, the following new ability can be selected instead of the standard 20th level class ability which would normally be gained. In some cases, a capstone specifies what ability it replaces. A character can’t select an alternative capstone if she has previously traded away her class capstone via an archetype. Clerics and wizards can receive a capstone at 20th level, despite not having one to begin with.

#### Tactical Genius (Ex)

At 20th level, the cavalier is a maestro of the battlefield, commanding and moving troops like so many game pieces. The cavalier gains a bonus teamwork feat, can grant up to three bonus feats with tactician, and increases the range of tactician by 90 feet.

## Favored Class Bonuses

Instead of receiving an additional skill rank or hit point whenever they gain a level in a favored class, some races have the option of choosing from a number of other bonuses, depending upon their favored classes. The following options are available to the listed race who have cavalier as their favored class, and unless otherwise stated, the bonus applies each time you select the listed favored class reward.

Race | Bonus | Source  
---|---|---  
Paizo  
Core Races  
Dwarf | Add +½ to the cavalier’s bonus to damage against targets of the cavalier’s challenge. | ARG  
Elf | Add +1 hit point to the cavalier’s mount. If the elf ever replaces this mount, the new mount gains these bonus hit points. These bonuses only apply to a single mount gained as part of the cavalier’s class. | APG  
Gnome | Add +1 to the cavalier’s mounted base speed. In combat this has no effect unless the cavalier has selected this reward five times (or another increment of five). If the cavalier ever replaces this mount, the new mount gains this bonus to its speed. | ARG  
Half-Elf | Add +1 foot to the cavalier’s mount’s base speed. In combat this has no effect unless the cavalier has selected this reward five times (or another increment of five). If the cavalier ever replaces this mount, the new mount gains this bonus to its speed. | ARG  
Half-Orc | Add +1 hit point to the cavalier’s mount. If the cavalier ever replaces this mount, the new mount gains these bonus hit points. | ARG  
Halfling | Add +½ to the cavalier’s effective class level for the purposes of determining the damage dealt when making an attack of opportunity against a challenged foe. | ARG  
Human | Add +¼ to the cavalier’s banner bonus. | APG  
Other Races  
Aasimar | Add +¼ to the cavalier’s bonus on damage against targets of his challenge. | PRG:ARG  
Catfolk | Add +¼ to the cavalier’s banner bonus. | ARG  
Goblin | Add +1 hit points to the cavalier’s mount companion. If the cavalier ever replaces his mount, the new mount gains these bonus hit points. | PRG:ARG  
Hobgoblin | Add a +½ bonus on Intimidate checks and Ride checks. | ARG  
Kobold | Add 5 feet (up to 15 feet maximum) to the cavalier’s mount’s speed when it uses the charge or withdraw action. | PRG:ARG

Drow | Add +¼ to the cavalier’s bonus on damage against targets of his challenge. | JBE:BoHRC  
Duergar | Add ½ to the cavalier’s bonus to damage against targets of his challenge. | JBE:BoHRC

Hobgoblin | Add a +½ bonus on Intimidate checks and Ride checks. | JBE:BoHRC  
Orc | Add +1 to the cavalier’s CMB when making bull rush or overrun combat maneuvers against a challenged target. | JBE:BoHRC  
Ratfolk | Add +1 foot to the size of all the cavalier’s tactician class features. This option has not effect unless the cavalier has selected it 5 times (or another increment off 5); an increase of 14 feet is effectively the same as +10 feet to the tactician feet feature, for example. | JBE:BoHRC  
Tiefling | The cavalier’s mount gains resistance 1 against cold, electricity or fire. Each time the cavalier selects this reward, increase the mount’s resistance to one off these energy times by 1 (to a maximum of 5 for each one type).

## Archetypes & Alternate Class Features

When a character selects a class, he must choose to use the standard class features found or those listed in one of the archetypes presented here. Each alternate class feature replaces a specific class feature from its parent class. For example, the elemental fist class feature of the monk of the four winds replaces the stunning fist class feature of the monk. When an archetype includes multiple class features, a character must take all of them—often blocking the character from ever gaining certain familiar class features, but replacing them with equally powerful options. All of the other class features found in the core class and not mentioned among the alternate class features remain unchanged and are acquired normally when the character reaches the appropriate level (unless noted otherwise). A character who takes an alternate class feature does not count as having the class feature that was replaced when meeting any requirements or prerequisites.

A character can take more than one archetype and garner additional alternate class features, but none of the alternate class features can **replace or alter the same class feature** from the core class as another alternate class feature. For example, a paladin could not be both a hospitaler and an undead scourge since they both modify the smite evil class feature and both replace the aura of justice class feature. A paladin could, however, be both an undead scourge and a warrior of the holy light, since none of their new class features replace the same core class feature.

Archetypes are a quick and easy way to specialize characters of a given class, adding fun and flavorful new abilities to already established adventurers. Characters may take more than one archetype if they meet the requirements.

The following are cavalier archetypes. Unless stated otherwise, cavaliers of any order can take these archetypes.

Table: Archetypes / Alternate Class Features Archetype / Alternate Class Feature | Class Features Changed or Replaced
