# Shaman

While some heroes speak to gods or consort with otherworldly muses, shamans commune with the spirits of the world and the energies that exist in every living thing. These divine adventurers draw upon their power to shape the world and expand the influence of their spiritual patrons. Shamans have strong ties to natural spirits. They form powerful bonds with particular spirits, and as their power grows they learn to call upon other spirits in times of need.

**Role** : Shamans make for potent divine spellcasters, capable of using divine spells and the power of their spirits to aid their allies and destroy their foes. While they aren’t the healers that clerics are, they can still fill that role when needed.

**Alignment** : Any.

**Hit Die** : d8.

**Parent Classes** : Oracle and witch.

**Starting Wealth** : 3d6 × 10 gp (average 105 gp.) In addition, each character begins play with an outfit worth 10 gp or less.

### Class Skills

The shaman’s class skills are Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Fly (Dex), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), and Survival (Wis).

**Skill Ranks per Level** : 4 + Int modifier.

### Class Features

The following are the class features of the shaman.

#### Weapon and Armor Proficiency

A shaman is proficient with all simple weapons, and with light and medium armor.

#### Spell Casting

A shaman casts divine spells drawn from the shaman spell list. A shaman must choose and prepare her spells in advance.

To prepare or cast a spell, a shaman must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell’s level. The saving throw DC against a shaman’s spell is 10 + the spell’s level + the shaman’s Wisdom modifier.

Like other spellcasters, a shaman can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on **Table: Shaman**. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score.

Shamans commune with their spirit animals to prepare their spells. Each shaman must choose a time when she must spend 1 hour each day in quiet contemplation with her spirit animal to regain her daily allotment of spells. A shaman can prepare and cast any spell on the shaman spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily communion.

#### Orisons

Shamans can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day as noted on **Table: Shaman**. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.

#### Spirit (Su)

A shaman forms a mystical bond with the spirits of the world. She forms a lasting bond with a single spirit, which grants a number of abilities and defines many of her other class features.

At 1st level, a shaman gains the spirit ability granted by her chosen spirit. She adds the spells granted by that spirit to the list of spells that she can cast using spirit magic. She also adds the hexes possessed by that spirit to the list of hexes that she can use with the hex and wandering hex class features.

At 8th level, the shaman gains the abilities listed in the greater version of her selected spirit. At 16th level, the shaman gains the abilities listed for the true version of her selected spirit.

If the shaman takes levels in another class that grants a mystery (such as the oracle), the spirit and mystery must match, even if that means one of them must change. Subject to GM discretion, the shaman can change her former mystery or spirit to make them conform.

#### Spirit Animal (Ex)

At 1st level, a shaman forms a close bond with a spirit animal tied to her chosen spirit. This animal is her conduit to the spirit world, guiding her along the path to enlightenment. The animal also aids a shaman by granting her a special ability. A shaman must commune with her spirit animal each day to prepare her spells. While the spirit animal does not store the spells like a witch’s familiar does, the spirit animal serves as her conduit to divine power. If a shaman’s spirit animal is slain, she cannot prepare new spells or use her spirit magic class feature until the spirit animal is replaced.

#### Spirit Animal

By communing with the incredible powers of her spirit, the shaman forges a cherished bond with one specific servant of that spirit—known as a spirit animal. A spirit animal is a creature chosen by a shaman to serve as a conduit, allowing her to more fully access the magic of her spirit on a daily basis. The shaman’s spirit animal also grants her special powers. This ability uses the same rules as the wizard’s arcane bond class feature and is treated as a familiar, except as noted below.

A shaman uses her level as her effective wizard level when determining the abilities of her spirit animal. A shaman can select any familiar available to wizards to serve as her spirit animal, although her spirit animal is augmented by the power of her chosen spirit. Once selected, the spirit animal cannot be changed. Although a shaman’s spirit animal uses the statistics of a specific animal, it is treated as an outsider with the native subtype for the purposes of spells and abilities that affect it.

Levels of different classes that are entitled to familiars stack with shaman levels for the purpose of determining any spirit animal abilities that depend on the shaman’s level. If a shaman possesses such levels in other classes, her spirit animal always uses the shaman rules for spirit animals, not those used by familiars of other classes (such as witches, wizards, or sorcerers with the arcane bloodline). If the shaman has witch levels, her spirit animal also serves as the conduit to her patron and stores her witch spells. The shaman’s spirit animal is treated as a familiar for the purposes of all spells, effects, and abilities that affect familiars.

If a spirit animal is lost or dies, it can be replaced after 24 hours through a special ritual that consumes material components worth 500 gp per shaman level. The ritual takes 8 hours to complete. The new spirit animal must be of the same sort of creature as the previous one.

##### Spirit Animal (Ex)

At 1st level, a shaman’s spirit animal gains specific abilities, depending upon the type of spirit selected by the shaman using her spirit class feature. These abilities affect the animal’s appearance and grant it special abilities that can aid it in serving the shaman and the spirit it represents and is connected to. These abilities are described in the spirit animal section of each individual spirit description.

_Deliver Touch Spells (Su)_ : If a shaman is 3rd level or higher, her spirit animal can deliver touch spells or hexes for her. If the shaman and the spirit animal are in contact at the time the shaman casts a touch spell, she can designate her animal as the “toucher.” The spirit animal can then deliver the touch spell just as the shaman would. If the shaman casts another spell before the touch is delivered, the touch spell dissipates. If the shaman activates a hex, her spirit animal can be used to make the touch; she doesn’t have to be in contact with the animal to use this ability with hexes.

#### Spirit Magic

A shaman can spontaneously cast a limited number of spells per day beyond those she prepared ahead of time. She has one spell slot per day of each shaman spell level she can cast, not including orisons. She can choose these spells from the list of spells granted by her spirits (see the spirit class feature and the wandering spirit class feature) at the time she casts them. She can enhance these spells using any metamagic feat that she knows, using up a higher-level spell slot as required by the feat and increasing the time to cast the spell (see Spontaneous Casting and Metamagic Feats).

#### Hex

A shaman learns a number of magical tricks, called hexes, which grant her powers or weaken foes. At 2nd level, a shaman learns one hex. At 4th, 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, 18th, and 20th level, the shaman learns new hexes. A shaman can select from any of the following hexes or from any of the hexes listed in the description of her chosen spirit. A shaman cannot select a hex more than once unless noted otherwise.

Using a hex is a standard action that doesn’t provoke an attack of opportunity unless otherwise noted. The saving throw DC to resist a hex is equal to 10 + 1/2 the shaman’s level + the shaman’s Wisdom modifier.

_Chant (Su)_ : A shaman can chant as a move action. Any creature that is within 30 feet that is under the effects of the shaman’s charm, evil eye, fortune, fury, or misfortune hex has that effect’s duration extended by 1 round. A shaman cannot select both this hex and the witch’s cackle hex.

_Charm (Su)_ : A shaman charms an animal or humanoid creature within 30 feet by beckoning and speaking soothing words. This improves the attitude of an animal or humanoid creature by 1 step, as if the shaman had successfully used the Diplomacy skill. The effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to the shaman’s Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). A successful Will saving throw negates this effect. Whether or not the save is successful, the creature cannot be the target of this hex again for 24 hours. At 8th level, this effect improves the attitude of the creature by 2 steps. This is a mind-affecting charm effect.

_Draconic Resilience (Ex)_ : The shaman grants a creature she touches some of the magically resilient nature of dragons, causing the creature to be immune to magical sleep effects for a number of rounds equal to the shaman’s level. At 7th level, the creature is also immune to paralysis for this duration. Once a creature has benefited from the draconic resilience hex, it cannot benefit from this hex again for 24 hours. **Source** PPC:HftF

_Evil Eye (Su)_ : The shaman causes doubt to creep into the mind of a foe within 30 feet that she can see. The target takes a –2 penalty on one of the following (shaman’s choice): ability checks, AC, attack rolls, saving throws, or skill checks. This hex lasts a number of rounds equal to 3 + the shaman’s Wisdom modifier. A successful Will saving throw reduces this to just 1 round. At 8th level, the penalty increases to –4. This is a mind-affecting effect.

_Fetish (Ex)_ : The shaman receives Craft Wondrous Item as a bonus feat and gains a +4 insight bonus on Spellcraft checks to identify magic items permanently.

_Fortune (Su)_ : The shaman grants a creature within 30 feet a bit of good luck for 1 round. The target can call upon this good luck once per round, allowing it to reroll any ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or skill check, taking the better result. The target creature must to decide to use this ability before the first roll is made. At 8th and 16th levels, the duration of this hex increases by 1 round. Once a creature has benefited from the fortune hex, it cannot benefit from it again for 24 hours.

_Fury (Su)_ : A shaman incites a creature within 30 feet into a primal fury. The target receives a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls and a +2 resistance bonus on saving throws against fear for a number of rounds equal to the shaman’s Wisdom modifier. At 8th and 16th levels, these bonuses increase by 1. Once a creature has benefited from the fury hex, it cannot benefit from it again for 24 hours.

_Healing (Su)_ : A shaman soothes the wounds of those she touches. This acts as cure light wounds, using the shaman’s caster level. Once a creature has benefited from the healing hex, it cannot benefit from it again for 24 hours. At 5th level, this acts as cure moderate wounds.

_Intimidating Display (Ex)_ : The shaman can call upon some of the majesty and power of dragons to cow her enemies. The shaman gains Dazzling Display as a bonus feat, even if she does not meet the prerequisites, and she can use it even when not wielding a weapon. **Source** PPC:HftF

_Misfortune (Su)_ : The shaman causes a creature within 30 feet to suffer grave misfortune for 1 round. Anytime the creature makes an ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or skill check, it must roll twice and take the worse result. A successful Will saving throw negates this hex. At 8th level and 16th level, the duration of this hex is extended by 1 round. This hex affects all rolls the target must make while it lasts. Whether or not the save is successful, the creature cannot be the target of this hex again for 24 hours.

_Secret (Ex)_ : The shaman receives one metamagic feat as a bonus feat. The shaman must meet the prerequisites for the feat.

_Shapeshift (Su)_ : The shaman transforms herself into another form for a number of minutes per day equal to her level, as alter self. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but must be spent in 1-minute increments. Changing form (including changing back) is a standard action that doesn’t provoke an attack of opportunity. At 8th level, this ability works as beast shape I. At 12th level, this ability works as beast shape II. At 16th level, this ability works as beast shape III. At 20th level, this ability works as beast shape IV.

_Silkstring Snare (Su)_ : The shaman causes ribbons of spider silk to erupt from the ground beneath a single creature. The target must succeed at a Reflex save or be entangled and anchored in place. The foe can escape the silk as a standard action with a successful Escape Artist or Strength check at the same DC, or by dealing an amount of damage to the silk equal to double the shaman’s class level (the silk has hardness 0). This hex lasts a number of rounds equal to 3 + the shaman’s Wisdom modifier. A creature affected by this hex cannot be affected by it again for 24 hours. PZO9480

_Tongues (Su)_ : The shaman understands any spoken language for a number of minutes per day equal to her level, as comprehend languages. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments. At 5th level, a shaman can use this ability to speak any language, as tongues.

_Ward (Su)_ : The shaman places a protective ward over one creature. The warded creature receives a +2 deflection bonus to AC and a +2 resistance bonus on saving throws. This effect lasts until the warded creature is hit or fails a saving throw. A shaman knows when a warded creature is no longer protected. A shaman can have only one ward active at a time. If the shaman uses this hex while a previous ward is still active, that previous ward immediately ends. A shaman cannot use this ability on herself. At 8th and 16th levels, the bonuses provided by this ward increase by 1.

_Wings (Su)_ : The shaman can grow a pair of wings for a number of minutes per day equal to her level. These minutes do not need to be consecutive, but they must be spent in 1-minute increments. Initially, these wings lack the power to allow the shaman to fly, but the shaman can use them as a secondary natural attack that deals 1d3 points of damage (1d2 for a Small shaman). At 3rd level, she can use the wings to safely descend any distance, as if using the feather fall spell. At 7th level, she can use the wings to fly with poor maneuverability and a fly speed of 30 feet, but the shaman must land at the end of each turn or fall. A shaman of 8th level or higher can select the wings hex a second time. This doubles the number of minutes per day the shaman can use her wings (2 minutes per level), and allows her to fly with average maneuverability and a fly speed of 30 feet while the wings are active. **Source** PPC:HftF

_Witch Hex_ : The shaman selects any one hex normally available through the witch’s hex class feature. She treats her shaman level as her witch level when determining the powers and abilities of the hex. She uses her Wisdom modifier in place of her Intelligence modifier for the hex. She cannot select major hexes or grand hexes using this ability. The shaman cannot select a witch hex that has the same name as a shaman hex.

#### Wandering Spirit (Su)

At 4th level, a shaman can form a temporary bond with a spirit other than the one selected using her spirit class feature. She must make this selection each day when preparing her spells. While this feature is active, she gains the spirit ability granted by the spirit. She also adds the spells granted by that spirit to her list of spells that she can cast using spirit magic. She does not add the hexes from her wandering spirit to her list of hexes that she can choose from with the hex class feature. At 12th level, she gains the abilities listed in the greater version of her wandering spirit. At 20th level, she gains the ability listed in the true version of her wandering spirit.

#### Wandering Hex

At 6th level, a shaman can temporarily gain the use of one of the hexes possessed by either one of her spirits. She must make this selection each day when she prepares her spells. For the purposes of this ability, she can select any hex possessed by her spirit or wandering spirit. If she selects it from her wandering spirit, she loses the hex immediately if she bonds with another spirit, although she can then select a different hex to gain using this ability, from either her spirit or her new wandering spirit. At 14th level, a shaman can select two wandering hexes each day instead of one. This ability otherwise functions as the hex class feature.

#### Manifestation (Su)

Upon reaching 20th level, a shaman undergoes a transformation as she manifests as a pinnacle of her main spirit. The nature of this manifestation depends on the shaman’s spirit, and is described in its entry.

### Alternative Capstone Ability

**Source** PPC:CoL

When a character reaches the 20th level of a class, she gains a powerful class feature or ability, sometimes referred to as a capstone. When a character reaches 20th level in this class, the following new ability can be selected instead of the standard 20th level class ability which would normally be gained. In some cases, a capstone specifies what ability it replaces. A character can’t select an alternative capstone if she has previously traded away her class capstone via an archetype. Clerics and wizards can receive a capstone at 20th level, despite not having one to begin with.

#### Hex Mastery (Su)

At 20th level, the shaman has learned ever more terrible hexes. She can select one grand hex from the list available to witches.

### Spirits

Each shaman must select from the following spirits. Unless otherwise noted, the DC to save against the special abilities granted by a spirit is equal to 10 + 1/2 the shaman’s level + the shaman’s Wisdom modifier.
