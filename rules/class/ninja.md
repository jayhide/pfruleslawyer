# Ninja

When the wealthy and the powerful need an enemy eliminated quietly and without fail, they call upon the ninja. When a general needs to sabotage the siege engines of his foes before they can reach the castle walls, he calls upon the ninja. And when fools dare to move against a ninja or her companions, they will find the ninja waiting for them while they sleep, ready to strike. These shadowy killers are masters of infiltration, sabotage, and assassination, using a wide variety of weapons, practiced skills, and mystical powers to achieve their goals.

**Role** : The ninja spends almost all of her time honing her skills, practicing her art, or working on her next assignment. Even when not specifically working, the ninja is ever vigilant and ready for the situation to turn deadly. Her line of work earns her many enemies, but it is a list that she frequently reduces through assassination and misdirection.

**Note** : The ninja is an alternate class for the rogue core class.

**Alignment** : Any.

**Hit Die** : d8.

**Starting Wealth** : 4d6 × 10 gp (average 140 gp.) In addition, each character begins play with an outfit worth 10 gp or less.

### Class Features

The following are the class features of the ninja.

#### Weapon and Armor Proficiency

Ninja are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the kama, katana, kusarigama, nunchaku, sai, shortbow, short sword, shuriken, siangham, and wakizashi. They are proficient with light armor but not with shields.

#### Poison Use

At 1st level, a ninja is trained in the use of poison and cannot accidentally poison herself when applying poison to a weapon.

#### Sneak Attack

Precision Damage & Critical Hits

Precision damage (such as that dealt by a ninja’s sneak attack ability) applies to more creatures than it did in previous editions of the game.

Some may balk at this but it can easily be imagined or explained as the ninja having found a weak point in the undead’s “body” (such as a zombie’s head) or even finding a crack or flaw in a construct’s “body.”

There is some degree of confusion as to what should separate a “critical hit” from a “precision-based attack” but in any event, in some cases they are treated differently.

Critical Hits

The following creature types (or subtypes) have immunity to critical hits (that is, they do not take any additional damage from critical hits):

  * **Aeon (subtype)** : “ _Immunity to cold, poison, and critical hits._ “
  * **Elemental (subtype)** : Elementals are “ _not subject to critical hits orflanking. Does not take additional damage from precision-based attacks, such as sneak attack._“
  * **Incorporeal (subtype)** : “ _An incorporeal creature is immune to critical hits (unless the attacks are made using a weapon with theghost touch special weapon quality.)_“
  * **Ooze (Type)** : <Oozes are…> “ _not subject to critical hits orflanking. Does not take additional damage from precision-based attacks (such as sneak attack.)_“
  * **Protean (subtype)** : _(50% chance to ignore, see below*)_
  * **Swarm (Type)** : “ _A swarm has no clear front or back and no discernible anatomy, so it is not subject to critical hits._ “



Precision-Based Damage (like Sneak Attack)

The following creature types (or subtypes) do not take additional damage from precision-based attacks (such as sneak attack):

  * **Elemental (subtype)** : “<An elemental…> _does not take additional damage from precision-based attacks (such as sneak attack.)_ “
  * **Incorporeal (subtype)** : “ _An incorporeal creature is immune to precision-based damage (such assneak attack damage) unless the attacks are made using a weapon with the ghost touch special weapon quality._“
  * **Ooze (Type)** : “<An ooze is…> _does not take additional damage from precision-based attacks (such as sneak attack.)_ “
  * **Protean (subtype)** : _(50% chance to ignore, see below*)_



Creatures Immune to Flanking

Opponents do not gain any special flanking bonuses against the following creature types (or subtypes):

  * **Ooze (Type)** : “<An ooze is…> _not subject to …flanking._“
  * **Swarm (Type)** : “ _A swarm has no clear front or back and no discernible anatomy, so it is not subject toflanking._“
  * **Elemental (subtype)** : “<Elementals are…> _not subject toflanking._“



***Special** : Proteans have a special ability called “ _Amorphous Anatomy”_ which might protect them: “<_Amorphous Anatomy >_ grants <a protean> a 50% chance to ignore additional damage caused by critical hits and sneak attacks,”

If a ninja can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage.

The ninja’s attacks deal extra damage anytime her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the ninja flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and increases by 1d6 every two ninja levels thereafter. Bonus damage from sneak attacks is precision damage. Should the ninja score a critical hit with a sneak attack, this precision damage is not multiplied. Ranged attacks count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet.

With a weapon that deals nonlethal damage (such as a sap, unarmed strike, or whip), a ninja can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack, even with the usual –4 penalty.

The ninja must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot, and must be able to reach this spot. A ninja cannot sneak attack while striking a creature that has concealment.

#### _Ki_ Pool (Su)

At 2nd level, a ninja gains a pool of _ki_ points, supernatural energy she can use to accomplish amazing feats. The number of points in the ninja’s _ki_ pool is equal to 1/2 her ninja level + her Charisma modifier. As long as she has at least 1 point in her _ki_ pool, she treats any Acrobatics skill check made to jump as if she had a running start. At 10th level, she also reduces the DC of Acrobatics skill checks made to jump by 1/2 (although she still cannot move farther than her speed allows).

By spending 1 point from her _ki_ pool, a ninja can make one additional attack at her highest attack bonus, but she can do so only when making a full attack. In addition, she can spend 1 point to increase her speed by 20 feet for 1 round. Finally, a ninja can spend 1 point from her _ki_ pool to give herself a +4 insight bonus on Stealth checks for 1 round. Each of these powers is activated as a swift action. A ninja can gain additional powers that consume points from her _ki_ pool by selecting certain ninja tricks.

The _ki_ pool is replenished each morning after 8 hours of rest or meditation; these hours do not need to be consecutive. If the ninja possesses levels in another class that grants points to a _ki_ pool, ninja levels stack with the levels of that class to determine the total number of _ki_ points in the combined pool, but only one ability score modifier is added to the total. The choice of which score to use is made when the second class ability is gained, and once made, the choice is set. The ninja can now use _ki_ points from this pool to power the abilities of every class she possesses that grants a _ki_ pool.

#### Ninja Tricks

As a ninja continues her training, she learns a number of tricks that allow her to confuse her foes and grant her supernatural abilities. Starting at 2nd level, a ninja gains one ninja trick. She gains one additional ninja trick for every 2 levels attained after 2nd. Unless otherwise noted, a ninja cannot select an individual ninja trick more than once.

Tricks marked with an asterisk (*) add effects to a ninja’s sneak attack. Only one of these tricks can be applied to an individual attack and the decision must be made before the attack is made.

A complete listing of ninja tricks can be found here: Ninja Tricks

#### No Trace (Ex)

At 3rd level, a ninja learns to cover her tracks, remain hidden, and conceal her presence. The DC to track a ninja using the Survival skill increases by +1. In addition, her training gives her a +1 insight bonus on Disguise skill checks and on opposed Stealth checks whenever she is stationary and does not take any action for at least 1 round. Every three levels thereafter, the increase to Survival DCs and the bonuses on Disguise and opposed Stealth checks increase by 1.

#### Uncanny Dodge (Ex)

Starting at 4th level, a ninja can react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She cannot be caught flat-footed, nor does she lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. She still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A ninja with this ability can still lose her Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against her.

If a ninja already possesses uncanny dodge from a different class, she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge instead.

#### Light Steps (Ex)

At 6th level, a ninja learns to move while barely touching the surface underneath her. As a full-round action, she can move up to twice her speed, ignoring difficult terrain. While moving in this way, any surface will support her, no matter how much she weighs. This allows her to move across water, lava, or even the thinnest tree branches. She must end her move on a surface that can support her normally. She cannot move across air in this way, nor can she walk up walls or other vertical surfaces. When moving in this way, she does not take damage from surfaces or hazards that react to being touched, such as lava or caltrops, nor does she need to make Acrobatics checks to avoid falling on slippery or rough surfaces. Finally, when using light steps, the ninja ignores any mechanical traps that use a location-based trigger.

#### Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex)

At 8th level, a ninja can no longer be flanked. This defense denies another ninja (or rogue) the ability to sneak attack the ninja by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least four more ninja (or rogue) levels than the target does.

If a character already has uncanny dodge from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack when determining the minimum ninja (or rogue) level required to flank the character.

#### Master Tricks

At 10th level, and every two levels thereafter, a ninja can select a master trick in place of a ninja trick. Unless otherwise noted, a ninja cannot select an individual ninja trick more than once.

Tricks marked with an asterisk (*) add effects to a ninja’s sneak attack. Only one of these tricks can be applied to an individual attack and the decision must be made before the attack is made.

A complete listing of ninja master tricks can be found here: Ninja Master Tricks

#### Hidden Master (Su)

At 20th level, a ninja becomes a true master of her art. She can, as a standard action, cast greater invisibility on herself. While invisible in this way, she cannot be detected by any means, and not even invisibility purge, see invisibility, and true seeing can reveal her. She uses her ninja level as her caster level for this ability. Using this ability consumes 3 _ki_ points from her _ki_ pool. In addition, whenever the ninja deals sneak attack damage, she can sacrifice additional damage dice to apply a penalty to one ability score of the target equal to the number of dice sacrificed for 1 minute. This penalty does not stack with itself and cannot reduce an ability score below 1.

### Alternative Capstone Ability

**Source** PPC:CoL

When a character reaches the 20th level of a class, she gains a powerful class feature or ability, sometimes referred to as a capstone. When a character reaches 20th level in this class, the following new ability can be selected instead of the standard 20th level class ability which would normally be gained. In some cases, a capstone specifies what ability it replaces. A character can’t select an alternative capstone if she has previously traded away her class capstone via an archetype. Clerics and wizards can receive a capstone at 20th level, despite not having one to begin with.

#### Slicing Wind (Su)

At 20th level, the ninja is a creature of wind and blades. When using light steps, the ninja can move up to four times her speed and make a single attack at her highest base attack bonus at any point during the movement.
