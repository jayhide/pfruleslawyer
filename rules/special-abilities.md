The following special abilities include rules commonly used by a number of creatures, spells, and traps.

### Extraordinary Abilities (Ex)

Extraordinary abilities are non-magical. They are, however, not something that just anyone can do or even learn to do without extensive training. Effects or areas that suppress or negate magic have no effect on extraordinary abilities.

### Spell-Like Abilities (Sp)

Spell-like abilities, as the name implies, are magical abilities that are very much like spells. Spell-like abilities are subject to spell resistance and [dispel magic](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/dispel-magic/). They do not function in areas where magic is suppressed or negated (such as an [antimagic field](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/a/antimagic-field/)). Spell-like abilities can be dispelled but they cannot be counterspelled or used to [counterspell](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/#Counterspells).

### Supernatural Abilities (Su)

Supernatural abilities are magical but not [spell-like](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/#Spell-Like_Abilities_Sp). Supernatural abilities are not subject to spell resistance and do not function in areas where magic is suppressed or negated (such as an [antimagic field](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/a/antimagic-field/)). A supernatural ability’s effect cannot be dispelled and is not subject to counterspells. See **Table: Special Ability Types** for a summary of the types of special abilities.

Table: Special Ability Types Effect | Extraordinary  
Ability | Spell-Like  
Ability | Supernatural  
Ability  
---|---|---|---  
Can [dispel magic](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/dispel-magic/) and similar spells dispel the effects of abilities of that type? | No | Yes | No  
Does spell resistance protect a creature from these abilities? | No | Yes | No  
Does an [antimagic field](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/a/antimagic-field/) or similar magic suppress the ability? | No | Yes | Yes  
Does using the ability provoke [attacks of opportunity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat/#Attacks_of_Opportunity) the way that casting a spell does? | No | Yes | No  
  
#### Blindsight

Some creatures possess blindsight, the extraordinary ability to use a non-visual sense (or a combination senses) to operate effectively without vision. Such senses may include sensitivity to vibrations, acute scent, keen hearing, or echolocation. This makes [invisibility](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/i/invisibility/) and [concealment](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat/#Concealment) (even magical [darkness](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/darkness/)) irrelevant to the creature (though it still can’t see ethereal creatures). This ability operates out to a range specified in the creature description.

  * Blindsight never allows a creature to distinguish color or visual contrast. A creature cannot read with blindsight.
  * Blindsight does not subject a creature to [gaze](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules/#Gaze_Su) attacks (even though darkvision does).
  * Blinding attacks do not penalize creatures that use blindsight.
  * Deafening attacks thwart blindsight if it relies on hearing.
  * Blindsight works underwater but not in a vacuum.
  * Blindsight negates [displacement](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/displacement/) and [blur](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/blur/) effects.



#### **Blindsense**

Blindsense lets a creature notice things it cannot see, but without the precision of blindsight. The creature with blindsense usually does not need to make [Perception](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perception/) checks to notice and locate creatures within range of its blindsense ability, provided that it has line of effect to that creature. Any opponent that cannot be seen has total [concealment](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat/#Concealment) (50% miss chance) against a creature with blindsense, and the blindsensing creature still has the normal miss chance when attacking foes that have [concealment](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat/#Concealment). Visibility still affects the movement of a creature with blindsense. A creature with blindsense is still denied its [Dexterity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores/#Dexterity_Dex) bonus to [Armor Class](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat/#Armor_Class) against attacks from creatures it cannot see.

#### Channel Resistance

Creatures with channel resistance gain a bonus on [Will saves](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat/#Saving_Throws) made against channeled energy. They add their bonus to any [Will saves](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat/#Saving_Throws) made to halve the damage and resist the effect.

#### Charm and Compulsion

Many abilities and spells can cloud the minds of characters and monsters, leaving them unable to tell friend from foeâor worse yet, deceiving them into thinking that their former friends are now their worst enemies. Two general types of enchantments affect characters and creatures: charms and compulsions.

Charming another creature gives the charming character the ability to befriend and suggest courses of action to his minion, but the servitude is not absolute or mindless. Charms of this type include the various [charm](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/#Enchantment) spells and some monster abilities. Essentially, a charmed character retains free will but makes choices according to a skewed view of the world.

  * A charmed creature doesn’t gain any magical ability to understand his new friend’s language.
  * A charmed character retains his original [alignment](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary/#Alignment) and allegiances, generally with the exception that he now regards the charming creature as a dear friend and will give great weight to his suggestions and directions.
  * A charmed character fights his former allies only if they threaten his new friend, and even then he uses the least lethal means at his disposal as long as these tactics show any possibility of success (just as he would in a fight with an actual friend).
  * A charmed character is entitled to an opposed [Charisma](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores/#Charisma_Cha) check against his master in order to resist instructions or commands that would make him do something he wouldn’t normally do even for a close friend. If he succeeds, he decides not to go along with that order but remains charmed.
  * A charmed character never obeys a command that is obviously suicidal or grievously harmful to him.
  * If the charming creature commands his minion to do something that the influenced character would be violently opposed to, the subject may attempt a new saving throw to break free of the influence altogether.
  * A charmed character who is openly attacked by the creature who charmed him or by that creature’s apparent allies is automatically freed of the spell or effect.



[Compulsion](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/#Enchantment) is a different matter altogether. A [compulsion](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/#Enchantment) overrides the subject’s free will in some way or simply changes the way the subject’s mind works. A [charm](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/#Enchantment) makes the subject a friend of the caster; a [compulsion](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/#Enchantment) makes the subject obey the caster.

Regardless of whether a character is charmed or compelled, he does not volunteer information or tactics that his master doesn’t ask for.

#### Damage Reduction

FAQ

How does DR (damage reduction) interact with magical effects that deal bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage?

Although the definition of damage reduction says “The creature takes normal damage from energy attacks (even non-magical ones), spells, [spell-like abilities](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/#Spell-Like_Abilities_Sp), and [supernatural](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/#Supernatural_Abilities_Su) abilities,” that’s actually just referring to damage that isn’t specifically called out as being of a particular type, such as fire damage or piercing damage. In other words, DR doesn’t protect against “typeless damage” from magical attacks.

However, if a magical attack specifically mentions that it deals bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, DR affects that damage normally, as if it were from a physical weapon. (Otherwise the magical attack might as well not have a damage type, as it would only interface with B/P/S damage in a very few corner cases, such as whether or not an [ooze](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types/#Ooze) splits from that attack.)

For example, the [ice storm](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/i/ice-storm/) spell deals 3d6 points of bludgeoning damage and 2d6 points of cold damage. If you cast [ice storm](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/i/ice-storm/) at a group of [zombies](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/zombie/), the [zombie’s](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/zombie/) DR 5/slashing protects them against 5 points of the spell’s bludgeoning damage. Their DR doesn’t help them against the spell’s cold damage because DR doesn’t apply to energy attacks.

[[Source](http://paizo.com/paizo/faq/v5748nruor1fo#v5748eaic9qea)]

Some magic creatures have the [supernatural](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/#Supernatural_Abilities_Su) ability to instantly heal damage from weapons or ignore blows altogether as though they were invulnerable.

The numerical part of a creature’s damage reduction (or [DR](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules/#Damage_Reduction_Ex_or_Su)) is the amount of damage the creature ignores from normal attacks. Usually, a certain type of weapon can overcome this reduction (see Overcoming DR). This information is separated from the damage reduction number by a slash. For example, DR 5/magic means that a creature takes 5 less points of damage from all weapons that are not magic. If a dash follows the slash, then the damage reduction is effective against any attack that does not ignore damage reduction.

Whenever damage reduction completely negates the damage from an attack, it also negates most special effects that accompany the attack, such as injury [poison](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison/), a [monk’s](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/monk/) stunning, and injury-based [disease](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/diseases/). Damage Reduction does not negate [touch attacks](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat/#Touch_Attacks), energy damage dealt along with an attack, or energy drains. Nor does it affect poisons or diseases delivered by inhalation, ingestion, or contact.

Attacks that deal no damage because of the target’s damage reduction do not disrupt spells.

Spells, [spell-like abilities](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/#Spell-Like_Abilities_Sp), and energy attacks (even non-magical fire) ignore damage reduction.

Sometimes damage reduction represents instant healing. Sometimes it represents the creature’s tough hide or body. In either case, other characters can see that conventional attacks won’t work.

If a creature has damage reduction from more than one source, the two forms of damage reduction do not stack. Instead, the creature gets the benefit of the best damage reduction in a given situation.

##### Overcoming DR

DR Type | Weapon Enhancement  
Bonus Equivalent  
---|---  
[Cold iron](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/special-materials/#Iron_Cold) / [silver](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/special-materials/#Silver_Alchemical) | +3  
[Adamantine](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/special-materials/#Adamantine)* | +4  
Alignment-based | +5  
  
* Note that this does not give the ability to ignore [hardness](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/damaging-objects/#Hardness), like an actual [adamantine](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/special-materials/#Adamantine) weapon does.

Damage Reduction may be overcome by special materials, magic weapons (any weapon with a +1 or higher [enhancement bonus](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary/#TOC-Enhancement-Bonus), not counting the enhancement from masterwork quality), certain types of weapons (such as slashing or bludgeoning), and weapons imbued with an [alignment](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alignment-description/additional-rules/).

Ammunition fired from a projectile weapon with an [enhancement bonus](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary/#TOC-Enhancement-Bonus) of +1 or higher is treated as a magic weapon for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Similarly, ammunition fired from a projectile weapon with an [alignment](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alignment-description/additional-rules/) gains the alignment of that projectile weapon (in addition to any alignment it may already have).

Weapons with an [enhancement bonus](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary/#TOC-Enhancement-Bonus) of +3 or greater can ignore some types of damage reduction, regardless of their actual material or [alignment](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alignment-description/additional-rules/). The following table shows what type of [enhancement bonus](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary/#TOC-Enhancement-Bonus) is needed to overcome some common types of damage reduction.

#### Darkvision

Darkvision is the extraordinary ability to see with no light source at all, out to a range specified for the creature. Darkvision is black-and-white only (colors cannot be discerned). It does not allow characters to see anything that they could not see otherwiseâ[invisible](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions/#Invisible) objects are still invisible, and illusions are still visible as what they seem to be. Likewise, darkvision subjects a creature to [gaze](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules/#Gaze_Su) attacks normally. The presence of light does not spoil darkvision.

#### Death Attacks

In most cases, a death attack allows the victim a [Fortitude save](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat/#Saving_Throws) to avoid the effect, but if the save fails, the character dies instantly.

  * [Raise dead](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/raise-dead/) doesn’t work on someone killed by a death attack or effect.
  * Death attacks slay instantly. A victim cannot be made [stable](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions/#Stable) and thereby kept alive.
  * In case it matters, a [dead](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions/#Dead) character, no matter how he died, has [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary/#Hit_Points_hp) equal to or less than his negative [Constitution](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores/#Constitution_Con) score.
  * The spell [death ward](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/death-ward/) protects against these attacks.



#### Energy Drain and Negative Levels

Some spells and a number of [undead](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types/#Undead) creatures have the ability to drain away life and energy; this dreadful attack results in ânegative levels.â These cause a character to take a number of penalties.

For each negative level a creature has, it takes a cumulative â1 penalty on all ability checks, [attack rolls](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat/#Attack_Roll), [combat maneuver](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat/#Combat_Maneuvers) checks, [Combat Maneuver Defense](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat/#Combat_Maneuver_Defense), saving throws, and skill checks. In addition, the creature reduces its current and total [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary/#Hit_Points_hp) by 5 for each negative level it possesses. The creature is also treated as one level lower for the purpose of level-dependent variables (such as spellcasting) for each negative level possessed. Spellcasters do not lose any prepared spells or slots as a result of negative levels. If a creature’s negative levels equal or exceed its total [Hit Dice](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary/#Hit_Dice_HD), it dies.

A creature with temporary negative levels receives a new saving throw to remove the negative level each day. The DC of this save is the same as the effect that caused the negative levels.

Some abilities and spells (such as [raise dead](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/raise-dead/)) bestow permanent level drain on a creature. These are treated just like temporary negative levels, but they do not allow a new save each day to remove them. Level drain can be removed through spells like [restoration](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/restoration/). Permanent negative levels remain after a [dead](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions/#Dead) creature is restored to life. A creature whose permanent negative levels equal its [Hit Dice](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary/#Hit_Dice_HD) cannot be brought back to life through spells like [raise dead](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/raise-dead/) and [resurrection](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/resurrection/) without also receiving a [restoration](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/restoration/) spell, cast the round after it is restored to life.

#### Energy Immunity and Vulnerability

A creature with energy immunity never takes damage from that energy type. Vulnerability means the creature takes half again as much (+50%) damage as normal from that energy type, regardless of whether a saving throw is allowed or if the save is a success or failure.

#### Energy Resistance

A creature with resistance to energy has the ability (usually extraordinary) to ignore some damage of a certain type per attack, but it does not have total immunity.

Each resistance ability is defined by what energy type it resists and how many points of damage are resisted. It doesn’t matter whether the damage has a mundane or magical source.

When resistance completely negates the damage from an energy attack, the attack does not disrupt a spell. This resistance does not stack with the resistance that a spell might provide.

#### Ethereal

An ethereal creature is [invisible](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions/#Invisible), insubstantial, and capable of moving in any direction, even up or down, albeit at half normal speed. An ethereal creature can move through solid objects, including living creatures. An ethereal creature can see and hear on the [Material Plane](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes/#Material_Plane), but everything looks gray and ephemeral. Sight and hearing onto the [Material Plane](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes/#Material_Plane) are limited to 60 feet.

Force effects and abjurations affect an ethereal creature normally. Their effects extend onto the [Ethereal Plane](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes/#Ethereal_Plane) from the [Material Plane](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes/#Material_Plane), but not vice versa. An ethereal creature can’t attack material creatures, and spells you cast while ethereal affect only other ethereal things. Certain material creatures or objects have attacks or effects that work on the [Ethereal Plane](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/environment/the-planes/#Ethereal_Plane).

An ethereal creature treats other ethereal creatures and ethereal objects as if they were material.

#### Fear (Su or Sp)

Spells, magic items, and certain monsters can affect characters with fear. In most cases, the character makes a [Will](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat/#Saving_Throws) saving throw to resist this effect, and a failed roll means that the character is [shaken](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions/#Shaken), [frightened](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions/#Frightened), or [panicked](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions/#Panicked).

**Shaken** : Characters who are [shaken](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions/#Shaken) take a â2 penalty on [attack rolls](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat/#Attack_Roll), [saving throws](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat/#Saving_Throws), [skill checks](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/#Skill_Checks), and ability checks.

**Frightened** : Characters who are [frightened](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions/#Frightened) are [shaken](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions/#Shaken), and in addition they flee from the source of their fear as quickly as they can. They can choose the paths of their flight. Other than that stipulation, once they are out of sight (or hearing) of the source of their fear, they can act as they want. If the duration of their fear continues, however, characters can be forced to flee if the source of their fear presents itself again. Characters unable to flee can fight (though they are still [shaken](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions/#Shaken)).

**Panicked** : Characters who are [panicked](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions/#Panicked) are [shaken](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions/#Shaken), and they run away from the source of their fear as quickly as they can, dropping whatever they are holding. Other than running away from the source, their paths are random. They flee from all other dangers that confront them rather than facing those dangers. Once they are out of sight (or hearing) of any source of danger, they can act as they want. [Panicked](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions/#Panicked) characters [cower](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions/#Cowering) if they are prevented from fleeing.

**Becoming Even More Fearful** : Fear effects are cumulative. A [shaken](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions/#Shaken) character who is made [shaken](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions/#Shaken) again becomes [frightened](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions/#Frightened), and a [shaken](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions/#Shaken) character who is made [frightened](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions/#Frightened) becomes [panicked](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions/#Panicked) instead. A [frightened](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions/#Frightened) character who is made [shaken](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions/#Shaken) or [frightened](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions/#Frightened) becomes [panicked](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions/#Panicked) instead.

Fear attacks can have various effects.

**Fear Aura (Su)** The use of this ability is a free action. The aura can freeze an opponent (as in the case of a mummyâs despair) or function like the fear spell. Other effects are possible. A fear aura is an area effect. The descriptive text gives the size and kind of the area.

**Fear Cone (Sp) and Ray (Su)** These effects usually work like the fear spell.

If a fear effect allows a saving throw, it is a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the fearsome creatureâs racial HD + that creatureâs Charisma modifier; the exact DC is given in the creatureâs descriptive text). All fear attacks are mind-affecting fear effects.

**Format** : fear aura (30 ft., DC 17); Location: Aura.

**Format** : fear cone (50 ft., DC 19); Location: Special Attacks.

#### Invisibility

The ability to move about unseen is not foolproof. While they can’t be seen, invisible creatures can be heard, smelled, or felt.

Invisibility makes a creature undetectable by vision, including darkvision.

Invisibility does not, by itself, make a creature immune to critical hits, but it does make the creature immune to extra damage from being a [ranger’s](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/ranger/) [favored enemy](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/ranger/#Favored_Enemy_Ex) and from [sneak attacks](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue/#Sneak_Attack).

A creature can generally notice the presence of an active invisible creature within 30 feet with a DC 20 [Perception](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perception/) check. The observer gains a hunch that âsomething’s thereâ but can’t see it or target it accurately with an attack. It’s practically impossible (+20 DC) to pinpoint an invisible creature’s location with a [Perception](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perception/) check. Even once a character has pinpointed the square that contains an invisible creature, the creature still benefits from total [concealment](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat/#Concealment) (50% miss chance). There are a number of modifiers that can be applied to this DC if the invisible creature is moving or engaged in a noisy activity.

Invisible creature is… | Perception  
DC Modifier  
---|---  
In combat or speaking | â20  
Moving at half speed | â5  
Moving at full speed | â10  
Running or charging | â20  
Not moving | +20  
Using [Stealth](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/stealth/) | [Stealth](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/stealth/) check +20  
Some distance away | +1 per 10 feet  
Behind an obstacle (door) | +5  
Behind an obstacle (stone wall) | +15  
  
A creature can grope about to find an invisible creature. A character can make a [touch attack](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat/#Touch_Attacks) with his hands or a weapon into two adjacent 5-foot squares using a [standard action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/gamemastering/combat/#Standard_Action). If an invisible target is in the designated area, there is a 50% miss chance on the [touch attack](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat/#Touch_Attacks). If successful, the groping character deals no damage but has successfully pinpointed the invisible creature’s current location. If the invisible creature moves, its location, obviously, is once again unknown.

If an invisible creature strikes a character, the character struck knows the location of the creature that struck him (until, of course, the invisible creature moves). The only exception is if the invisible creature has a reach greater than 5 feet. In this case, the struck character knows the general location of the creature but has not pinpointed the exact location.

If a character tries to attack an invisible creature whose location he has pinpointed, he attacks normally, but the invisible creature still benefits from full [concealment](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat/#Concealment) (and thus a 50% miss chance). A particularly large and slow invisible creature might get a smaller miss chance.

If a character tries to attack an invisible creature whose location he has not pinpointed, have the player choose the space where the character will direct the attack. If the invisible creature is there, conduct the attack normally. If the enemy’s not there, roll the miss chance as if it were there and tell him that the character has missed, regardless of the result. That way the player doesn’t know whether the attack missed because the enemy’s not there or because you successfully rolled the miss chance.

If an invisible character picks up a visible object, the object remains visible. An invisible creature can pick up a small visible item and hide it on his person (tucked in a pocket or behind a cloak) and render it effectively invisible. One could coat an invisible object with flour to at least keep track of its position (until the flour falls off or blows away).

Invisible creatures leave tracks. They can be tracked normally. Footprints in sand, mud, or other soft surfaces can give enemies clues to an invisible creature’s location.

An invisible creature in the water displaces water, revealing its location. The invisible creature, however, is still hard to see and benefits from [concealment](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat/#Concealment).

A creature with the scent ability can detect an invisible creature as it would a visible one.

A creature with the [Blind-Fight](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/blind-fight-combat/) feat has a better chance to hit an invisible creature. Roll the miss chance twice, and he misses only if both rolls indicate a miss. (Alternatively, make one 25% miss chance roll rather than two 50% miss chance rolls.)

A creature with blindsight can attack (and otherwise interact with) creatures regardless of invisibility.

An invisible burning torch still gives off light, as does an invisible object with a [light](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/l/light/) or similar spell cast upon it.

Ethereal creatures are invisible. Since ethereal creatures are not materially present, [Perception](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perception/) checks, scent, [Blind-Fight](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/blind-fight-combat/), and blindsight don’t help locate them. [Incorporeal](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules/#Incorporeal_Ex) creatures are often invisible. Scent, [Blind-Fight](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/blind-fight-combat/), and blindsight don’t help creatures find or attack invisible, [incorporeal](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types/#Incorporeal) creatures, but [Perception](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perception/) checks can help.

Invisible creatures cannot use [gaze](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules/#Gaze_Su) attacks.

Invisibility does not thwart [divination](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/#Divination) spells.

Since some creatures can detect or even see invisible creatures, it is helpful to be able to hide even when invisible.

#### Low-Light Vision

Characters with low-light vision have eyes that are so sensitive to light that they can see twice as far as normal in dim light. Low-light vision is color vision. A spellcaster with low-light vision can read a [scroll](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/scrolls/) as long as even the tiniest candle flame is next to him as a source of light.

Characters with low-light vision can see outdoors on a moonlit night as well as they can during the day.

#### Paralysis

Some monsters and spells have the [supernatural](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/#Supernatural_Abilities_Su) or [spell-like ability](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/#Spell-Like_Abilities_Sp) to [paralyze](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions/#Paralyzed) their victims, immobilizing them through magical means. Paralysis from [poison](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison/) is discussed in the [Afflictions section](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/).

A [paralyzed](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions/#Paralyzed) character cannot move, speak, or take any physical action. He is rooted to the spot, frozen and [helpless](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions/#Helpless). Not even friends can move his limbs. He may take purely mental actions, such as casting a spell with no [components](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/#Components).

A winged creature flying in the air at the time that it becomes [paralyzed](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions/#Paralyzed) cannot flap its wings and falls. A swimmer can’t swim and may drown.

#### Scent

This extraordinary ability lets a creature detect approaching enemies, sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell.

A creature with the [scent](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules/#Scent_Ex) ability can detect opponents by sense of smell, generally within 30 feet. If the opponent is upwind, the range is 60 feet. If it is downwind, the range is 15 feet. Strong scents, such as smoke or rotting garbage, can be detected at twice the ranges noted above. Overpowering scents, such as [skunk](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/skunk/) musk or [troglodyte](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/humanoids/troglodyte/) [stench](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules/#Stench_Ex), can be detected at three times these ranges.

The creature detects another creature’s presence but not its specific location. Noting the direction of the scent is a [move action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat/#Move_Action). If the creature moves within 5 feet (1 square) of the scent’s source, the creature can pinpoint the area that the source occupies, even if it cannot be seen.

A creature with the [Survival](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/survival/) skill and the [scent](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules/#Scent_Ex) ability can follow tracks by smell, making a [Survival](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/survival/) check to find or follow a track. A creature with the [scent](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules/#Scent_Ex) ability can attempt to follow tracks using [Survival](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/survival/) untrained. The typical DC for a fresh trail is 10. The DC increases or decreases depending on how strong the quarry’s odor is, the number of creatures, and the age of the trail. For each hour that the trail is cold, the DC increases by 2. The ability otherwise follows the rules for the [Survival](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/survival/) skill in regards to tracking. Creatures tracking by scent ignore the effects of surface conditions and poor visibility.

Creatures with the scent universal monster ability have a +8 bonus on Perception checks made to detect a scent.[[source](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/SKILLS/PERCEPTION/#modifiers)]

Creatures with the [scent](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules/#Scent_Ex) ability can identify familiar odors just as [humans](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/human/) do familiar sights.

Water, particularly running water, ruins a trail for air-breathing creatures. Water-breathing creatures that have the [scent](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules/#Scent_Ex) ability, however, can use it in the water easily.

False, powerful odors can easily mask other scents. The presence of such an odor completely spoils the ability to properly detect or identify creatures, and the base [Survival](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/survival/) DC to track becomes 20 rather than 10.

#### Spell Resistance

Spell resistance (abbreviated **SR**) is the extraordinary ability to avoid being affected by spells. Some spells also grant spell resistance.

To affect a creature that has spell resistance, a spellcaster must make a [caster level](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/#Caster_Level) check (1d20 + [caster level](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/#Caster_Level)) at least equal to the creature’s spell resistance. The defender’s spell resistance is like an [Armor Class](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat/#Armor_Class) against magical attacks. If the caster fails the check, the spell doesn’t affect the creature. The possessor does not have to do anything special to use spell resistance. The creature need not even be aware of the threat for its spell resistance to operate.

Only spells and [spell-like abilities](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/#Spell-Like_Abilities_Sp) are subject to spell resistance. Extraordinary and [supernatural](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/#Supernatural_Abilities_Su) abilities (including enhancement bonuses on magic weapons) are not. A creature can have some abilities that are subject to spell resistance and some that are not. Even some spells ignore spell resistance; see **When Spell Resistance Applies** , below.

A creature can voluntarily lower its spell resistance. Doing so is a [standard action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/gamemastering/combat/#Standard_Action) that does not provoke an [attack of opportunity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat/#Attacks_of_Opportunity). Once a creature lowers its resistance, it remains down until the creature’s next turn. At the beginning of the creature’s next turn, the creature’s spell resistance automatically returns unless the creature intentionally keeps it down (also a [standard action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/gamemastering/combat/#Standard_Action) that does not provoke an [attack of opportunity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat/#Attacks_of_Opportunity)).

A creature’s spell resistance never interferes with its own spells, items, or abilities.

A creature with spell resistance cannot impart this power to others by touching them or standing in their midst. Only the rarest of creatures and a few magic items have the ability to bestow spell resistance upon another.

Spell resistance does not stack, but rather overlaps.

##### When Spell Resistance Applies

Each spell includes an entry that indicates whether spell resistance applies to the spell. In general, whether spell resistance applies depends on what the spell does.

Targeted Spells

Spell resistance applies if the spell is targeted at the creature. Some individually targeted spells can be directed at several creatures simultaneously. In such cases, a creature’s spell resistance applies only to the portion of the spell actually targeted at that creature. If several different resistant creatures are subjected to such a spell, each checks its spell resistance separately.

Area Spells

Spell resistance applies if the resistant creature is within the spell’s area. It protects the resistant creature without affecting the spell itself.

Effect Spells

Most effect spells [summon](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules/#Summon_Sp) or create something and are not subject to spell resistance. Sometimes, however, spell resistance applies to effect spells, usually to those that act upon a creature more or less directly, such as [_web_](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/w/web/).

Spell resistance can protect a creature from a spell that’s already been cast. Check spell resistance when the creature is first affected by the spell.

Check spell resistance only once for any particular casting of a spell or use of a [spell-like ability](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/#Spell-Like_Abilities_Sp). If spell resistance fails the first time, it fails each time the creature encounters that same casting of the spell. Likewise, if the spell resistance succeeds the first time, it always succeeds. If the creature has voluntarily lowered its spell resistance and is then subjected to a spell, the creature still has a single chance to resist that spell later, when its spell resistance is back up.

Spell resistance has no effect unless the energy created or released by the spell actually goes to work on the resistant creature’s mind or body. If the spell acts on anything else and the creature is affected as a consequence, no roll is required. Spell-resistant creatures can be harmed by a spell when they are not being directly affected.

Spell resistance does not apply if an effect fools the creature’s senses or reveals something about the creature.

Magic actually has to be working for spell resistance to apply. Spells that have instantaneous durations but lasting results aren’t subject to spell resistance unless the resistant creature is exposed to the spell the instant it is cast.

##### Successful Spell Resistance

Spell resistance prevents a spell or a [spell-like ability](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/#Spell-Like_Abilities_Sp) from affecting or harming the resistant creature, but it never removes a magical effect from another creature or negates a spell’s effect on another creature. Spell resistance prevents a spell from disrupting another spell.

Against an ongoing spell that has already been cast, a failed check against spell resistance allows the resistant creature to ignore any effect the spell might have. The magic continues to affect others normally.
