From curses to poisons to diseases, there are a number of afflictions that can affect a creature. While each of these afflictions has a different effect, they all function using the same basic system. All afflictions grant a saving throw when they are contracted. If successful, the creature does not suffer from the affliction and does not need to make any further rolls. If the saving throw is a failure, the creature falls victim to the affliction and must deal with its effects.

Afflictions require a creature to make a saving throw after a period of time to avoid taking certain penalties. With most afflictions, if a number of saving throws are made consecutively, the affliction is removed and no further saves are necessary. Some afflictions, usually supernatural ones, cannot be cured through saving throws alone and require the aid of powerful magic to remove. Each affliction is presented as a short block of information to help you better adjudicate its results.

**Name** : This is the name of the affliction.

**Type** : This is the type of the affliction, such as curse, disease, or poison. It might also include the means by which it is contracted, such as contact, ingestion, inhalation, injury, spell, or trap.

**Save** : This gives the type of save necessary to avoid contracting the affliction, as well as the DC of that save. Unless otherwise noted, this is also the save to avoid the affliction's effects once it is contracted, as well as the DC of any caster level checks needed to end the affliction through magic, such as [remove curse](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/remove-curse) or [neutralize poison](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/n/neutralize-poison).

**Onset** : Some afflictions have a variable amount of time before they set in. Creatures that come in contact with an affliction with an onset time must make a saving throw immediately. Success means that the affliction is avoided and no further saving throws must be made. Failure means that the creature has contracted the affliction and must begin making additional saves after the onset period has elapsed. The affliction's effect does not occur until after the onset period has elapsed and then only if further saving throws are failed.

**Frequency** : This is how often the periodic saving throw must be attempted after the affliction has been contracted (after the onset time, if the affliction has any). While some afflictions last until they are cured, others end prematurely, even if the character is not cured through other means. If an affliction ends after a set amount of time, it will be noted in the frequency. For example, a disease with a frequency of "1/day" lasts until cured, but a poison with a frequency of "1/round for 6 rounds" ends after 6 rounds have passed.

Afflictions without a frequency occur only once, immediately upon contraction (or after the onset time if one is listed).

**Effect** : This is the effect that the character suffers each time if he fails his saving throw against the affliction. Most afflictions cause ability damage or hit point damage. These effects are cumulative, but they can be cured normally. Other afflictions cause the creature to take penalties or other effects. These effects are sometimes cumulative, with the rest only affecting the creature if it failed its most recent save. Some afflictions have different effects after the first save is failed. These afflictions have an initial effect, which occurs when the first save is failed, and a secondary effect, when additional saves are failed, as noted in the text. Hit point and ability score damage caused by an affliction cannot be healed naturally while the affliction persists.

**Cure** : This tells you how the affliction is cured. Commonly, this is a number of saving throws that must be made consecutively. Even if the affliction has a limited frequency, it might be cured prematurely if enough saving throws are made. Hit point damage and ability score damage is not removed when an affliction is cured. Such damage must be healed normally. Afflictions without a cure entry can only be cured through powerful spells, such as [neutralize poison](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/n/neutralize-poison) and [remove curse](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/remove-curse). No matter how many saving throws are made, these afflictions continue to affect the target.

He failed a DC 15 [Fortitude](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude) save to avoid contracting it, so after the onset period of 1d3 days has passed, he must make another DC 15 [Fortitude](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude) save to avoid taking 1d6 points of [Strength](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-) damage. From this point onward, he must make a DC 15 [Fortitude](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude) save each day (according to the disease's frequency) to avoid further [Strength](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-) damage. If, on two consecutive days, he makes his [Fortitude](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude) saves, he is cured of the disease and any damage it caused begins to heal as normal.

## Diseases and Poisons Optional Rules

**Source** [PFU](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1601257155/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1601257155&linkCode=as2&tag=httpwwwd20pfs-20&linkId=SUELYCMD4O5LZ3U6)

The standard rules for diseases and poisons don't necessarily mimic the progression of these afflictions in a believable way; a character with a few [lesser restoration](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/restoration) spells can simply ignore most diseases, and diseases and poisons that don't affect your [Constitution](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-) score can never kill you. What's more, because these afflictions tend to affect ability scores, their effects can be unrealistically powerful—a [poison](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison) that damages [Intelligence](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-) can take down any creature of [animal](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal) intelligence, regardless of CR. The following optional system presents progression tracks for diseases and poisons that cause the victim's situation to become increasingly worse.

### Progression and End States

When a victim fails his initial save and is afflicted with a [disease](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/diseases) or [poison](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison), he immediately gains the effects of the first step down that affliction's progression track. For diseases, this is latent/carrier; for poisons, it's usually weakened.

This replaces the affliction's normal effects (such as [ability damage](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage) and [ability drain](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Drain)), though many afflictions still produce additional symptoms. At the GM's discretion, truly deadly diseases and poisons might cause the victim to start further along the progression track than normal.

All effects from disease and poison tracks are cumulative.

Most afflictions also have an end state—a point at which the [disease](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/diseases) or [poison](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison) has progressed as far as it can. Once an affliction has reached its end state, the victim keeps all current effects (but doesn't suffer further effects) and can no longer attempt saving throws to recover from the affliction. By default, each [disease](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/diseases) and poison track has an end state of [dead](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dead), but some afflictions have less severe end states, and others might progress only to a certain intermediate state at worst, allowing victims to continue attempting saves.

In general, whenever a victim fails a saving throw against her affliction, she moves one step further down the progression track, gaining the effects of the next state and keeping all previous effects, until she reaches the end state. If she's afflicted with a [disease](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/diseases), she moves one step back toward healthy whenever she fulfills the conditions in the [disease's](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/diseases) Cure entry (usually by succeeding at one or more saves). Once she reaches healthy, she is cured. Poisons work differently—fulfilling the cure condition removes a [poison](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison) from the victim's system, but she remains at the same step on the track and recovers gradually. (Treat a [poison](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison) that has exhausted its duration in the same way.) For every day of bed rest (or 2 nights of normal rest), a victim recovers one step; this recovery is doubled as normal by [Heal](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/heal) checks, and tenacious poisons might require a longer recovery period. Usually, [neutralize poison](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/n/neutralize-poison) or [remove disease](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/remove-disease) immediately moves the victim to a healthy state on the respective track, and a [heal](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/h/heal) spell will work for both. However, once the [disease](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/diseases) or [poison](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison) has reached its end state, only a more powerful spell such as [miracle](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/m/miracle) or [wish](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/w/wish) can remove its effects.

Some diseases and poisons cause the same effects as a condition (such as [sickened](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Sickened)) or render characters [paralyzed](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Paralyzed). Effects that modify or remove those conditions (such as immunities) do not apply; only effects and immunities that help against diseases or poisons apply, as appropriate.

### Diseases

The disease track simulates the progression of a [disease](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/diseases), starting with incubation. Ignore any onset entry for a [disease](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/diseases); the victim attempts saving throws at a rate based on the [disease's](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/diseases) frequency. At the GM's discretion, if the [disease's](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/diseases) cure entry does not allow a cure, the [disease's](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/diseases) progression may be irreversible without the use of a [heal](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/h/heal) spell, and even a successful [remove disease](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/remove-disease) only prevents further deterioration.

There are two different tracks: one for diseases that affect physical ability scores (such as bubonic plague or slimy doom), and one for those that affect mental ability scores (such as cackle fever or mindfire).

### Physical Disease Track

Healthy—Latent/Carrier—Weakened—Impaired—Disabled—Bedridden—Comatose—Dead

**Latent/Carrier** : A character in this stage has the [disease](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/diseases), and may pass it on if contagious, but suffers no ill effects.

**Weakened** : A character weakened by a physical [disease](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/diseases) suffers all the effects of the [sickened](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Sickened) and [fatigued](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Fatigued) conditions. Impaired: A character impaired by a physical [disease](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/diseases) also suffers the effects of the [exhausted](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Exhausted) condition. Whenever he takes a [standard action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions), he must succeed at a [Fortitude](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude) save at the same DC as the [disease's](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/diseases) DC or lose the action and gain the [nauseated](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Nauseated) condition for 1 minute.

**Disabled** : A character [disabled](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Disabled) by a physical [disease](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/diseases) gains the [disabled](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Disabled) condition. If he takes a [standard action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions), his [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points) drop by 1 or to −1, whichever is worse.

**Bedridden** : A character rendered bedridden by a physical [disease](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/diseases) is awake and can converse, but he can't stand on his own or take any standard or move actions.

**Comatose** : A character rendered comatose by physical [disease](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/diseases) is [unconscious](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Unconscious) and feverish. He can't be woken by any means as long as he remains in this state on the disease track.

**Dead** : The [disease](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/diseases) overcomes the body's immune system, and the character dies. The corpse may be still be contagious, and some diseases may have unusual effects after the character dies.

### Mental Disease Track

Healthy—Latent/Carrier—Weakened—Impaired—Befuddled—Deranged—Comatose—Dead

**Latent/Carrier** : A character in the latent stage has the [disease](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/diseases), and may pass it on if contagious, but suffers no ill effects.

**Weakened** : A character weakened by a mental [disease](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/diseases) suffers all the effects of the [shaken](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Shaken) condition. The DCs of her spells and [spell-like abilities](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-) decrease by 2. If she is a spellcaster, she can no longer cast her highest level of spells.

**Impaired** : A character impaired by a mental [disease](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/diseases) no longer adds her mental ability score modifiers to the number of uses per day of pools (such as an arcane pool or a [_ki_ pool](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/monk#TOC-Ki-Pool-Su-)), abilities (such as channel and [lay on hands](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/paladin#TOC-Lay-On-Hands-Su-)), and bonus spells per day. Her DCs decrease by an additional 2. If she is a spellcaster, she can no longer cast her 2 highest levels of spells.

**Befuddled** : A character befuddled by a mental [disease](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/diseases) is losing her grasp on thought, reality, and self. She has a 50% chance each round to take no relevant action, instead babbling randomly, wandering off, or talking to unseen things.

**Deranged** : A character rendered deranged by a mental [disease](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/diseases) is almost entirely disconnected from reality. Her mind filters and twists all external stimuli into strange forms.

**Comatose** : A character rendered comatose by a mental [disease](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/diseases) has lost all grip on reality and entered an inner world of dreams. She can't be woken by any means as long as she remains in this state on the disease track.

**Dead** : The [disease](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/diseases) has harmed the character's brain beyond repair, killing her. The corpse may still be contagious, and some diseases may have unusual effects after the character dies.

### Poisons

The poison track simulates the progressive effects of [poison](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison) in the body. A character who is poisoned rolls a saving throw after the listed onset at the listed frequency. On an initial exposure to [poison](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison), regardless of whether her save succeeds, a victim takes an amount of [poison](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison) damage equal to the [poison's](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison) DC − 10, divided by 2 (for example, 5 points of [poison](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison) damage for a DC 20 [poison](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison)). This is hit point damage, not [ability damage](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Ability-Score-Damage). If a victim is exposed to additional doses of the same [poison](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison), a failed save progresses the poison track by one step and increases the duration by 50%, but doesn't increase the DC.

### Strength Poison Track

Healthy—Weakened—Impaired—Staggered—Immobile—Dead

**Weakened** : A character weakened by [Strength](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-) [poison](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison) suffers a −2 penalty on [Strength](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-)-based [attack rolls](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll), damage rolls, skill checks, and ability checks. Her carrying capacity is divided by 3. She is always considered to be carrying at least a medium load.

**Impaired** : A character impaired by [Strength](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-) [poison](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison) experiences rapid muscle atrophy. She takes an additional −2 penalty on the affected [Strength](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-)-based rolls, and is always considered to be carrying at least a heavy load.

**Staggered** : A character [staggered](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Staggered) by [Strength](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-) [poison](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison) is so weakened that she suffers the effects of the [staggered](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Staggered) condition (except she can take a [full-round action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Full-Round-Actions) if it is purely mental).

**Immobile** : A character rendered immobile by [Strength](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-) [poison](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison) cannot move her body at all. She is [helpless](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Helpless) and can take only purely mental actions.

**Dead** : All the character's muscles cease functioning, including the heart.

### Dexterity Poison Track

Healthy—Sluggish—Stiffened—Staggered—Immobile—Dead

**Sluggish** : A character rendered sluggish by [Dexterity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-) [poison](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison) has dulled reactions. He takes a −2 penalty on [Reflex](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex) saves and all [Dexterity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-)-based [attack rolls](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll), ability checks, and skill checks, as well as to AC.

**Stiffened** : A character stiffened by [Dexterity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-) [poison](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison) feels numb and stiff. He is considered [flat-footed](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Flat-Footed) and is denied his [Dexterity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-) bonus to AC, even if he has uncanny dodge. He can't make [attacks of opportunity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity).

**Staggered** : A character [staggered](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Staggered) by [Dexterity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-) [poison](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison) is so slowed and stiffened that he gains all the effects of the [staggered](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Staggered) condition (except that he can take a [full-round action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Full-Round-Actions) if it is purely mental).

**Immobile** : A character rendered immobile by [Dexterity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-) [poison](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison) cannot move his body at all. He is [helpless](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Helpless) and can take only purely mental actions.

**Dead** : The character's body becomes completely incapable of movement and dies.

### Constitution Poison Track

Healthy—Weakened—Impaired—Disabled—Unconscious—Dead

**Weakened** : A character whose health is weakened by [Constitution](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-) [poison](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison) takes a −2 penalty on all [Fortitude](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude) saves and [Constitution](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-) checks. Every time she attempts a [Fortitude](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude) save against the [poison](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison), whether she succeeds or fails, she takes damage as on initial exposure.

**Impaired** : A character impaired by [Constitution](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-) [poison](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison) takes an additional −2 penalty on the above checks.

**Disabled** : A character [disabled](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Disabled) by [Constitution](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-) [poison](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison) gains the [disabled](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Disabled) condition. If she takes a [standard action](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions), her [hit points](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points) drop by 1 or to −1, whichever is worse.

**Unconscious** : A character rendered [unconscious](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Unconscious) by [Constitution](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-) [poison](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison) enters a state of [shock](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/shock) and can't be woken by any means as long as she remains in this state.

**Dead** : The character's immune system is ravaged by the [poison](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison), and she expires.

### Intelligence Poison Track

Healthy—Weakened—Impaired—Animalistic—Comatose—Dead

**Weakened** : A character whose reason is weakened by [Intelligence](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-) [poison](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison) takes a −2 penalty on all [Intelligence](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-)-based skill checks and ability checks. A character with spellcasting based on [Intelligence](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-) decreases his DCs by 2 and can no longer cast his highest level of spells.

**Impaired** : A character impaired by [Intelligence](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-) [poison](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison) does not add his [Intelligence](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-) bonus to the number of uses per day of pools and abilities (such as an arcane pool) and does not gain bonus spells per day from his [Intelligence](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-). He takes an additional −2 penalty on the above [Intelligence](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-)-based rolls. An [Intelligence](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-)-based caster reduces his DCs by an additional 2, and he can no longer cast his 2 highest levels of spells.

**Animalistic** : A character rendered animalistic by [Intelligence](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-) [poison](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison) suffers the same effects as from a [feeblemind](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/f/feeblemind) spell, except his [Charisma](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-) and [Charisma](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-)-based skills are unaffected.

**Comatose** : A character rendered comatose by [Intelligence](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-) [poison](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison) is no longer able to process thoughts. He cannot be woken by any means as long as he remains in this state.

**Dead** : The character's brain stops functioning, and he dies.

### Wisdom Poison Track

Healthy—Weakened—Impaired—Confused—Comatose—Dead

**Weakened** : A character whose awareness is weakened by [Wisdom](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-) [poison](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison) takes a −2 penalty on all [Wisdom](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-)-based skill checks and ability checks, as well as on [Will](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will) saves. A character with spellcasting based on [Wisdom](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-) decreases her DCs by 2 and can no longer cast her highest level of spells.

**Impaired** : A character impaired by [Wisdom](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-) [poison](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison) does not add her [Wisdom](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-) bonus to the number of uses per day of pools and abilities (such as a [_ki_ pool](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/monk#TOC-Ki-Pool-Su-)) and does not gain bonus spells per day from her [Wisdom](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-). She takes an additional −2 penalty on the above [Wisdom](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-)-based rolls. A [Wisdom](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-)-based caster reduces her DCs by an additional 2, and can no longer cast her 2 highest levels of spells.

**Confused** : A character who's [confused](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Confused) by [Wisdom](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-) [poison](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison) has difficulty processing reality and is dangerous to herself and others. Each round, she rolls on the chart from the [confusion](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/c/confusion) spell to determine her actions.

**Comatose** : A character rendered comatose by [Wisdom](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-) [poison](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison) is no longer able to experience reality or receive sensory information. She can't be woken by any means as long as she remains in this state.

**Dead** : Forever lost in her own inner reality, the character's brain stops working, and she dies.

### Charisma Poison Track

Healthy—Weakened—Impaired—Pliable—Catatonic—Dead

**Weakened** : A character whose sense of self is weakened by [Charisma](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-) [poison](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison) takes a −2 penalty on all [Charisma](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-)-based skill checks and ability checks. A character with spellcasting based on [Charisma](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-) decreases his DCs by 2 and can no longer cast his highest level of spells.

**Impaired** : A character impaired by [Charisma](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-) [poison](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison) doesn't add his [Charisma](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-) bonus to the number of uses per day of pools and abilities (such as [lay on hands](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/paladin#TOC-Lay-On-Hands-Su-)) and doesn't gain bonus spells per day from his [Charisma](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-). He takes an additional −2 penalty on the above [Charisma](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-)-based rolls. A [Charisma](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-)-based caster reduces his DCs by an additional 2, and can no longer cast his 2 highest levels of spells.

**Pliable** : A character rendered pliable by [Charisma](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-) [poison](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison) has little sense of self and will go along with nearly anything. [Bluff](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/bluff), [Diplomacy](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/diplomacy), and [Intimidate](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/intimidate) checks automatically succeed against a pliable character, except [Diplomacy](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/diplomacy) checks to improve a pliable character's attitude, which have the normal DC. This still does not allow characters to whom the pliable character is unfriendly or hostile to make requests of the pliable character using [Diplomacy](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/diplomacy).

**Catatonic** : A character rendered catatonic by [Charisma](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-) [poison](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison) can see, hear, and process his environment, but has lost all agency and can't interact with the world in any way.

**Dead** : The character loses even autonomic functions, and dies.

## Inebriation

**Source** : PCS:IST

Two popular activities at many taverns—getting drunk and starting bar brawls—can help PCs blow off steam between adventures. Alternatively, a drinking contest can serve as a way to get important information from an NPC, while a well-timed fistfight in a tavern can enable the PCs to make a quick escape.

The following optional subsystems expand on the existing rules.

### Levels of Inebriation

The existing rules for drinking offer a binary state: once a character has consumed a number of beverages equal to 1 plus double her [Constitution](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-) modifier, she is [sickened](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Sickened) for a number of hours equal to the number of drinks above her maximum. The following system expands that into different levels, and characters progress depending on how quickly they consume alcoholic beverages.

Spells such as [lesser restoration](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/restoration) and [neutralize poison](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/n/neutralize-poison) and other similar effects that remove the [sickened](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Sickened) condition work automatically (even if the spell requires a [caster level](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Caster-Level) check) to render a character sober. Simply waiting can also return a character to a lower level of inebriation, as noted.

  1. **Sober** : You are currently unimpaired by alcohol. If you consume a number of alcoholic drinks equal to half your [Constitution](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-) modifier (minimum 1) within an hour or if you consume more than one alcoholic drink per hour for a number of hours equal to half your [Constitution](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-) modifier (minimum 1), you become tipsy.
  2. **Tipsy** : You are starting to feel the effects of alcohol. Depending on your temperament, your inhibitions might be slightly lowered or you might start to get mean. You take a -1 penalty on all [Dexterity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-)– and [Strength](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-)-based skill checks and on [Will](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will) saving throws. If you consume an additional number of alcoholic drinks equal to half your [Constitution](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-) modifier (minimum 1) within an hour or if you consume more than one alcoholic drink per hour for a number of hours equal to half your [Con](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-) modifier (minimum 1), you become drunk.
  3. **Drunk** : You are fully intoxicated. You might exhibit an exaggeration of your sober personality or a complete reversal thereof. You take a -2 penalty on ability checks, [attack rolls](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll), saving throws, and skill checks, but you gain [DR](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Damage-Reduction-Ex-or-Su-) 1/— against [nonlethal damage](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Nonlethal-Damage). If you consume an additional number of alcoholic drinks equal to your [Constitution](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-) modifier (minimum 1) within an hour, or if you consume more than one alcoholic drink per hour for a number of hours equal to your [Constitution](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-) modifier (minimum 1), you become soused. Every 2 hours in which you don't consume any alcohol, you can attempt a [Fortitude](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude) saving throw (DC = 10 + the number of alcoholic drinks you consumed since you were last sober). You receive a +1 bonus on this save for every additional 2 hours that pass without you consuming alcohol. If you succeed, you become tipsy.
  4. **Soused** : You have had far too much to drink. Your speech is slurred and your [judgment](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/inquisitor#TOC-Judgment-Su-) is impaired. You take a -4 penalty on ability checks, [attack rolls](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll), saving throws, and skill checks, but you gain [DR](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Damage-Reduction-Ex-or-Su-) 2/— against [nonlethal damage](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Nonlethal-Damage) and you can roll twice and take the better result on saving throws against pain effects. For every alcoholic drink you consume at this point, you must succeed at a [Fortitude](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude) save (DC = 15 + 1 per previous check) or pass out. Every 2 hours in which you don't consume any alcohol, you can attempt a [Fortitude](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude) saving throw (DC = 10 + the number of alcoholic drinks you consumed since you were last sober). You receive a +1 bonus on this save for every additional 2 hours that pass without you consuming alcohol. If you succeed, you become drunk.
  5. **Passed Out** : You have fully succumbed to alcohol's effects. You are [unconscious](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Unconscious) and will wake up naturally in 2d4 hours sober (though you might have a hangover; see below). You must also succeed at a DC 20 [Fortitude](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude) save or forget the previous 1d6 hours (or until you started drinking, whichever is shorter), as per [modify memory](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/m/modify-memory).

## Drinking and Fighting

This system assumes a character is drinking a standard alcoholic drink, such as a tankard of ale, a glass of wine, or a small amount of spirits, but some beverages (a triple-distilled moonshine, for instance) have a higher alcohol content. At the GM's discretion, a strong drink might count as two alcoholic beverages for the purpose of progressing to the next level of inebriation or impose a cumulative −2 penalty on the saving throw to avoid passing out. These penalties could be higher for incredibly strong drinks, though such drinks are often unfit for mortal consumption by typical mortals.

## Strong Drinks

Each hour in which you don't consume any alcohol, you can attempt a [Fortitude](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude) saving throw (DC = 10 + the number of alcoholic drinks you consumed since you were last sober). You receive a +1 bonus on this save for every additional hour that passes without you consuming alcohol. If you succeed, you become sober.

## Hangovers and Addiction

If a character passes out or goes to sleep while drunk or soused, there is a good chance that character wakes up with a hangover. When the character awakes, he must succeed at a [Fortitude](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude) saving throw (DC = 15 + the number of alcoholic drinks consumed) or become [sickened](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Sickened) until he gets another 8 hours of rest. [Lesser restoration](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/r/restoration) and similar magic can cure this [sickened](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Sickened) condition. In addition, the condition is removed if the affected character gets at least tipsy again.

At the GM's discretion, a character who gets drunk (or worse) more than three times every week for at least 4 consecutive weeks risks developing a moderate addiction with a DC dependent on the strength of the alcohol (DC 16 for most alcohols).

This DC increases by 2 for every additional consecutive week the character abuses alcohol. A character addicted to alcohol takes the penalties associated with the addiction whenever he isn't drunk (or worse).

## Drinking Games

Using these levels of inebriation, it is easy to stage a simple drinking contest between characters. These competitions usually see the contestants imbibing equal amounts of alcohol in a short period of time until someone quits or passes out. This can be a one-on-one contest or a group challenge, where the last drinker to quit or pass out wins.
