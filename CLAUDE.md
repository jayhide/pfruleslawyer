This is a repo that serves two purposes:
1) To scrape pathfinder 1e rules and content from the https://www.d20pfsrd.com/ website
2) To use RAG over the scraped rules to provide relevant context to an llm which answers questions on pathfinder 1e rules

poetry is used to track dependencies and maintain the environment for running code
